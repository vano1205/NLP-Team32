uh? Is he here again?
Who is it?
It's crazy. Really ... Stand up.
Yes?
Stop the car!
Thank you...
How do you ... go in and talk ...
No .. It's okay .. I like it here ... I just came to ask a few questions ...
Yes ... yes ...
How did you have a good funeral?
Yes..
I tried to go there too. Recently, there have been many incidents ...
Is the investigation completely over?
Yes?
Is the investigation over?
... Yes, as I said on the phone ...
I'm not very convinced. Nothing has been revealed properly.
No, you don't understand ...? I ... I understand my father's position. Normally, when a child has such a thing, he is not convinced like all parents and father. I understand. But your son's job comes from a psychological problem ... how do we know the psychology ... right?
Is there any specific reason for that?
Well, these days, the kids are not the same. I don't know how many suicide reports were filed this month. I can't count. But when it comes to suicide reasons, it's all ridiculous. I'm starting with sexual pessimism, and it's my girlfriend's problem.
... Isn't that so?
Yes ... no ... I'm just an example ... but it's written in the will. Hard. I can't stand it anymore. sorry. You saw it. No, but you can't tell us to investigate the cause as if we were to investigate the murder. We're not even psychologists ... right. Yes?
...
Please wait. Wait.
Detective ...
Yes?
Let's just go.
Hey Becky! What are you doing there alone? Illuwa, dude.
Hey! Why are you doing what you didn't do?
Just leave it alone. Maybe you want to be alone.
What happened?
Something ...
But why is that ...? uh?
What and why?
The atmosphere is strange ... Isn't there something between you?
Nothing like that ...
... 
Hey, I hit the bell. Go to your class. Don't mind.
Go up quickly, what are you doing?
What are you doing for?
Yes...
Are you a parent?
Yes ... I want to see you, but ...
You are not on vacation now.
...
Go to the administrative office. If it's urgent, go over there and make a call.
Where can I go ...?
Yes ... No ... I'm just going to visit you. No ... It's okay, really ... You don't have to go out effortlessly. Yes, yes ... I see.
What are you doing?
If you want to get your bags back, come here later.
If you don't come back like last time, I'll blow this bag.
Becky! Why did you come so late ... I thought you weren't coming ... huh? Would you like to keep waiting?
Hey, I missed you ... Don't be too late again. I burned your bag.
...
That's it, dude. Did I ever throw away your bag? A friend's bag ... uh?
Uh ... Uh ...
Hey ... Becky ...
uh...
fun?
...
It's fun ... Why split the thread? uh?
no...
no? Are you so damn cheap? No, how many eyes have you seen now? uh? One eyeball, two, three, four, this cub is wearing glasses, so four eyeballs, eight.
uh? Split again?
...
Am I funny? Why split the fuck? uh?
...
Don't break the fuck ... Why, you think I'm a funny guy ... huh?
I had an interview with my classmates, but there was no reason to guess.
... Can I meet them?
I do not know...
...
It's been a while since the kids were feeling cold ... I'm a little worried ... I hope that you can think about it because it's a college entrance exam and you need to study.
...
I've had interviews with the kids, but seeing them won't help you so much ...
... Did Gi-tae interview?
I had an interview, but there was nothing special. I'm so embarrassed ... I want to tell you something ...
You keep saying that there's nothing special ... You're the homeroom teacher, but can't you tell me how much the child has changed ... as usual ...
... ... Honestly ... I want to ask the same thing.
...
When I talked about it, I wasn't always good at talking about my father. When I was young, my mother also thought that I would be very close to my father because of my high school ...
... What do you mean?
Yes?
What do you mean ...
Ah ... I'm just thinking and telling you.
I think I lack understanding.
I don't understand what you mean, but please explain.
Oh, no.
I did not understand well. I'd like some explanation.
...
What are you doing? I was told to drink ...
Ah, yes ...
Did you come to the funeral?
Yes ... one day ... I went when it was.
Honestly, at the funeral, I'm insane and I don't remember who it is. It's familiar but ...
Right ... Because there are a lot of kids ... But how do you know me and contact me like this ...
I met my homeroom teacher. I asked the classmates' contact information. I talked to a few of them, and you said that you were friendly and friendly ...
...
You don't have to feel burdened ... just tell me comfortably.
Yes...
I wasn't expressing myself to friends around me. It wasn't because we weren't showing off our hard work ...
... okay...
...
I heard that Gi Tae didn't leave school, you know?
Yes...
You know you're so close and friendly, so you don't know a little ... what happened then?
I don't know why Gi-tae didn't come to school suddenly ...
Is it different?
Words are getting worse than usual ... It just looked dark, but I don't know why ...
Anything you can guess?
He didn't express us at all ... it was just too sudden. Nothing has changed significantly ... No matter how much I think about it, there's nothing to do with it ... I've told you a joke about the pressure on grades, but I don't think it might have affected ...
...
And Kee-tae told me this. You seem to be wrong with the other kids. I asked what it was ... I just said it was wrong ... I didn't know what I was saying, so I kept remembering it.
How long before that happened?
Yes...
...
Father, can you give me a cell phone for a while?
Call this number once. It's been a long time ago before I was transferred, but this friend will tell you something.
... 
I am studying in full swing, but I am sorry to come here.
no...
It's not going to be very busy since you're going up 3 ...?
Just fine.
When does school start ...?
About a week left.
Looking at the existing pictures, there were many pictures taken with you. There was one more with you ... I don't know who it is.
The other friend is Dongyun ...
Dongyoon?
Yes...
Hey, it's not my turn now !?
Last! Last! Really!
I can't find it ~ I just buy a new ball ...
Byeongshin, don't say that. Gi-tae is very much spared.
Baseball? Why?
Is Bo-kyung so good?
Say some times no.
What else is not ... This bitch, I'm not.
Wanna go to Wolmido this week? Together? Bokyung and her friends are together.
good! Let's go, let's go!
Becky, how are you?
I'm going ...
Crazy motherfucker, pretend you're sore.
Is it me?
T. Jonah, you asshole! Ugh ~
Hey, cleaning will come ...?
Talk a few times! Washing will come. Now you see it's weird?
What is it, baby?
Aren't you going to fill your greed?
No, dude! Anything, anything, for Becky ...
Do not be ridiculous! That's because you are cleaning!
Well, it doesn't have to be bad if it works well with me ...
This bastard, now reveal your true heart.
Be active. If you do not hesitate, you will lose your chance, man!
Ok
Look at Dong-yoon. It's fucking aggressive. You are only half dongyun. Already successful.
Okay ... Stop nagging. You look like a mother!
Call me mother.
Hey! come fast!! It's late !!
Ok! end!
That motherfucker, it's damn good again!
Tell me a few times to go.
Shut up! Don't rush me, baby!
Hey, this is not a big difference from my local Chinese house.
Just shut up and eat, dude. It tastes good ...
Is this delicious? uh?
Why? I'm delicious ...
Hey, are you two going to be like this? The two are the same, this is it, what is it?
What are you talking about? no!
No? But why do you defend Dongyun?
When did I defend Dongyun? I added that it was delicious ...
That's what Dongyun advocated.
Hey! Alright, shut up, eat fast, and let's go to Wolmi.
It's Gitae ...
It's Gitae.
uh?
This is delicious. Try it once.
Uh ... Uh ... Okay ...
I haven't eaten any dumplings yet?
Try it. The dumplings are really okay, here ...
What is it?
...uh?
What are you doing now?
...uh?
What are you doing?
...
Are you doing this to me to make him feel jealous? uh?
Hey, hey, why is this? Aunt, just a bottle of cider here ~
Hey, let's eat fast! I will do this.
Are they dating? what? I keep sticking together.
Becky and Gitae?
Uh ... But why does Hee-jun see Becky?
It's Baek Hee-jun. Becky.
What is that! Childishly ... absurd, really!
What are you talking about? You asshole!
Really ... I think Bokyung is interested in you ...
Hey, why are you so naive? uh?
...
Hey, she's a fox. Hey! It's because you deliberately feel jealous. uh? I do not know?
... I do not know...
Ugh! You asshole!
Ahhhhhhh !!! Hey hey hey!! Let it go !!
Just take care of what I lack, and I did. Gitae is also good at studying, so I can teach you anything I don't know, and because I have strength, I was able to comfortably live in school. No one touched me because I'm close to Gitae ...
What are you talking about having power?
I just ... the kids weren't careless ... they weren't weak enough to make other kids careless ...
That Gitae had that aspect ...
...
Honestly, it is a bit unfamiliar. Gi-tae usually doesn't talk or talk at home so much, so I feel strange about what you're talking about right now. I was really worried that Gitae was getting along with the kids at school. I have never seen Gi-tae bring her friends while at home ...
I haven't been there, but ... I think it was just uncomfortable. Friends coming to their house ... But Gitae played in my house or Dongyun's house a lot ...
You did ...
When I'm with my parents, when I'm with my friends, when I'm with my friends, I look wrong. Not just the default, but probably all.
So, did Ki-tae never have any problems at school?
Yes ... There was nothing like that until I was transferred ...
You were transferred a few weeks before anything happened ...
Yes.
You moved in a hurry with your vacation shortly ...
I just came here because of my family circumstances. I don't understand why Jaeho asked my father to go to me ... Because I was transferred almost a few weeks ago, I didn't know anything at all ...
Then, haven't you seen Ki Tae-rang since you transferred?
A few days after my transfer, Gitae was waiting for me at the entrance of my apartment complex. I said hello for a moment and I haven't seen it since.
Was there anything strange at that time?
I just ... I said something like this. It didn't look very different. I just said it briefly. I'm transferring. It seemed to be saying goodbye. It was the same as usual.
...
In Jaeho's words, it seemed that Gitae felt burdened with his grades ...
Jaeho?
Huh.
Honestly ... I don't think so. I wasn't a kid who would feel burdened with that, and I really didn't understand why Gitae made that choice. So, at the funeral, I asked the kids, but they just said that they didn't go to school one day. I think there must have been something big enough that I couldn't tell Gi-tae. I'm not impulsively making that choice.
The other friend in the picture ...
Yes...
Is it Dongyun?
Yes..
Was he also at the funeral?
no.
I was close ...
Yes ... I didn't come that day, I'm not sure ... I can't contact you ...
Can you tell me a bit? About that friend ...
Dongyun was ... Tae-tae and Dong-yoon had been friends since middle school.
Dongyun's friend was in the same class ...?
No ... He's a science class, so he's never been in the same class. I just became familiar with Dongyun through the introduction of Gitae, and the three of them played together. The three became close, but Dongyun and Gi Tae were special.
Is it special?
It was wrong with the other kids. Dong-i Dong for Ki-tae ... In my case, I'm a high school friend ... So even though I was really close, there was a wall on the other hand ...
...
However, Dongyun was in a state of exclusion and the only one who could speak equally.
...
To Dong-tae, Dong-yoon is wrong with me or the other kids ... You know, Dong-yoon. If you are Dongyun, you can tell me what your father wants.
...
Crazy motherfucker, are you calling on your cell phone to ask for a tissue at your house?
Be quiet, there are kids outside!
Okay, wipe it out quickly! It smells bad.
Oh, it's not fun.
Would you like to drink?
done. But when are your parents coming?
It will be tomorrow.
Then I sleep at your house today. uh?
...
No answer? Hey, what's going on? Why don't you talk, bastard?
Okay ...
Let's go and talk to Bokyung.
...
Nothing else? Oh, really.
... What were you talking about in the room?
Huh? What are you talking about?
I was talking with Bokyung in the room ...
saw?
I saw it and asked ...
Oh, I just didn't say anything.
...
Aren't you thinking weird?
Is there anything strange to think about?
Hey, don't get me wrong. Really!
What did I say? Why are thieves please?
...
...
I feel bad when I think about it. The thief is stepping on me ... What do you mean?
Why...?
What do you mean by that?
It doesn't mean anything ...
Hey, please don't do that!
Don't touch your head. please...
... how big was it? Becky. It was very big.
Don't talk like that. Am I your subordinate?
What is it? It's a joke, man.
...
It's still lower than what my mom told me to study!
You don't even attend academy at all.
I'd rather study ... fuck. What is it every weekend, what is it?
It's good to get paid!
Hey, damn it. Mom's flower shop .. it sucks!
It sounds full !!
I don't know, I didn't have the stress to study ...
Arrange the flowers, and you'll go great with you ~ Perfect!
Ah, I want to flower arrangement with my mom too!
me too.
There is a lot of work for you guys to really shout out.
Hey, hey, you know what happened yesterday?
What?
On the bridge ...
uh...
Does it make sense for the chicks to gather and smoke in the middle of the day? The blue chicks are wearing women.
Really? Hey, what are we?
Did you leave it still?
I saw it! But are the pups looking at me?
you?
Uh ... Uh! By the way, how many seven people do you count? I'm going to pass because I think I'm going to do something wrong, but when I think about it, I'm getting furious.
So what happened? Did you just let it go?
...
Why don't you talk? uh? How did it go?
I'm going to the bathroom for a moment.
...
Why is that?
what...?
You exchanged eyes with each other.
What are you talking about?
You exchanged eyes with each other ...
...
Didn't I see you
...
If you don't want to be in here, just talk.
... 
...
Because of what I said when the kids were ...
What are you talking about?
When you hear a story about your parents between your kids, they say nothing ... They say nothing and then turn the topic to something else.
So did you exchange your eyes? Like laughing?
I'm not laughing at you. Just what ... really what ...
So, did you exchange your eyes with Heejun?
...
Tell me, fuck.
Because of this, we don't even care. Is not it?
...
What are you talking about. Same.
Hey, I haven't been home with you in the last week.
Okay, after a long time, do you want to play baseball?
done. It says that I want to see the cleansing on my face.
No, dude. Let's go to baseball ...?
...
Yes, then let's catch the ball in a while.
Gitae, why are you so silent? Today, depending...
I have nothing to say.
There is one thing I want to talk about. Becky.
uh?
When you go home, your mother will cook and tell you to study ...
... What is it?
When I go home, I eat. I take care of it ... You don't have a mother.
...
That's it, that's about my parents that I can tell. Okay?
...
Why suddenly ...?
Okay?
...
I go to work first.
Why is that?
Already go?
I just can't study today ...
Will you come tomorrow?
I should. I'll go, see you tomorrow.
Uh, go.
Father, have you been there yet?
It came out sooner than I thought.
I just want to go home because I can't study.
So for me, sorry.
No ... if you have more to say ...
Nothing else ...
Yes...
I called Dongyun's friend's cell phone that I taught you before, but it was off ...
Oh, I haven't been contacted since ...
I'm really sorry to ask you to do this, but I hope you can help me to contact Dongyun.
... how do I ... how can I contact you ...
There will be friends around ...
...
Please...
...  Okay. I'll recognize it once.
Thank you.
No. I was uncomfortable like this ... Don't worry. I will call my father as soon as I get in touch.
okay? School? ... Why? Since when? ... Uh ... Then can't you contact Dongyun at all? Uh ... Uh ... I was wondering if I could contact you ... Oh, house number? No, I have it too ... draw ... If you get in touch, please call me. Please. Yes thank you Yes, yes ...
Becky, you're ruined.
Hey, do you chew Becky? It's a mess.
What?
You don't smoke anyway. uh?
Oh really...
Hey, look up and look down. Baby.
Hey, hey, it's a joke.
...
It's a joke ...
Okay ...
Hey, are you upset? What is it?
done...
Hey, get angry. Sorry...
Okay ...
Huh? Sorry. Really.
Okay, so ...
...
I'll go in first ...
Ah, fuck you real!
...
I said sorry.
You said I was sorry. uh? Why is that?
I told you I knew it.
Is it all you say?
...
Aren't you impressed?
...
Get the impression off!
Fuck, real. Fucking motherfucker ...
I'm not answering the phone.
okay?
Becky, isn't there something going on?
Nothing wrong ...
What do you sleep all day? uh?
Lift your head. This fucker.
Yes, I am here now. ... No, it's okay.
I'm doing this because I want to. ... No, Father, you don't have to come. I will contact you as soon as I meet you. Yes ... yes ... don't worry. Yes ... I will quit. Yes...
A long time.
Uh, it's been a long time.
How are you?
Why did you call it?
Do you know where Dongyun is?
Did you just call it out to ask?
Where is Dongyun?
... I don't know ... how do I know that. uh?
I met your father, Giah ... You know?
... Did you talk well?
I'm going to teach you my number what I know ...
No, I think your father is misunderstanding about Gitae ... You know best, Gitae is ...
What are you talking about?
You are the one who can best solve the part that your father misunderstands. Because of the default, I transferred ...
What does it have to do with the dead ...?
... I just wanted to solve my father's misunderstanding.
What happened? To Gitae ...
I don't know ... how do I know that ...
... why do you hide while you know something ...?
Fuck, on what grounds do you say that?
Then Dongyun will teach you the number. Why are you teaching me my number? uh? Why are you hiding things that Dongyun did and don't have?
There's nothing to hide ... I tried to teach Dong-yun's number ... Hey, what are you doing because Dong-yun taught you the number you can't reach? Don't you tell me something about Gitae ...
...
Dong-yoon hit the school. I haven't seen it in this town ... I haven't seen anyone ...
...
It wasn't Gi Tae or spectacles since you went. It wasn't normal ...
...
Aren't you the best? It looks like that ...
Aren't you the same?
...
...
Nothing ... Tell me a few times.
... is it real ...?
Why do you think so? What do you think Heejun and Me are doing?
I just think it's changed a bit lately ... Becky, you went without saying.
... There must be circumstances.
...
It's so cold ... Why is it so cold ...
It's not cold, it's not scary ...
...
What's scary. It's all over ...
I do not know...
You asshole, don't do anything like fighting. I can't even be surprised ... It's always before fighting, even after fighting, and I'm scared because I'm scared like this.
...
How disappointed the kids would be if they knew this. If you see this shaking ...
So you don't show me ...
Yes ... it's bold.
...
wake up. Let's go ...
Why are you doing this?
Nothing ...
Who is this?
...
Who is that? Talk to me.
... 
what?
What is it?
What are you doing?
What, dude?
Why ... Really?
Do you not know?
Don't get excited, just talk about it.
Fucking motherfuckers, what are you doing !?
Are you ... bad?
Shut up, fuck!
What!?
Stay still!
What happened, eh !?
Don't get excited ...
..!
Let's talk.
Talk to me. Why is that?
...
Why is that? What is the reason !?
Heejun tells you?
Heejun didn't say anything. I asked your classmates.
okay?
Why is that, huh?
What did I do ...
Don't pretend you don't know!
Why are you so overly wrong? Is Becky so special to you?
Say it? uh!?
He was self-willing.
Don't fuck up ... What did he do so wrong that Heejun made faces like that !? uh!?
What do you know
I'm not asking because I don't know !?
...
Tell me, why are you doing this?
It's just that simple ... That bastard is preposterous ...
How do you pretend? uh?
I don't like it. Is it okay?
Are you kidding me? Talk straight!
Never mind! Fuck!
...
... Usually I ... I'm done ... Talking ... uh?
...
But this time, if you don't talk in detail, please understand. Some things you can't explain ...
Stop it now.
....
No matter how close you are ... this is not real. If there's one more thing like this, I'm still not ...
What would you do if you didn't stay still?
You will see that.
...
What do you want to eat?
done...
You're hungry. You said you didn't even have dinner ...?
It's okay ...
I searched all the places you might be. Going to closed history ...
... okay?
I met Jaeho ...
...
Jaeho says you can't see at all in this town ...?
... When did you see ...
So ... why did you quit school ...?
What's going on with that fucking ...
Then what are you doing?
I just have to do the black exam ...
Are you not drinking?
uh? It's okay ... Is it a big deal at a transfer school?
I'm just studying ... Mother?
You know, it's late on weekdays.
How are you?
then...
...
I'm sorry I couldn't contact you ...
no...
Did you just come?
Today, Tae-tae's father stopped ...
okay...?
You wanted to meet ...
Why?
There must be something you want to ask.
...
Why didn't you come to the funeral of Taetae?
...
What happened?
Do you remember playing with the three at this time last year? I sleep in my house ...
I remember ...
Back then, while you were sleeping on the couch, Ki-tae and the two of you talked for a long time at this table ...
okay...?
Then I remember things ...
You don't have to tell me what happened. But I want you to meet with my father.
...
I don't know if you know anything related to the job, but ... you deserve to know whatever you're talking about. You're my father ...
...
I'll write down the number, so give me a call. Or maybe you were turning on your cell phone ... If you turn on your cell phone, you will probably receive a call. Please do not avoid because it's a favor ...
... 
I'm sorry I've been here so far and can only talk about this.
I'm sorry. I've seen it for a long time, but I can't greet you ... I'll see you later if it gets sorted out.
Yes ... Come back to the old Dongyun.
...
... This is the last thing Gi-tae gave me.
...
What are you doing?!
Why?
What, so much detergent? uh?
Isn't this enough?
Give it!
Come to our house like today and do it.
Don't be bullshit.
Really. Really! I didn't believe it either, but the picture was taken this time.
It's obvious that Yuf-o's photos are, well ...
No, this is fine. This is a low-flying photo!
Why are you always interested in that?
So hate it?
Hey, let's go there.
what?
Let's just play ...
Just go ~
Only bout ~
Have you tried this?
Huh. Long ago...
Would you do it too?
done...
So ... they were hanging out as if they were dating.
...
Say good bye once.
I told him ... Heejun doesn't say anything, and Gitae doesn't talk ...
Is there anything serious enough to tell you both ...?
I do not know...
There must be circumstances ...
...
...
It suits you to smile.
... Have you ever been branded ...?
Stigma ...?
Have you ever been branded by people ...?
Why is that?
just...
Where do you look?
what?
There's no stigma ...
That's it.
Walk straight ... get hurt ~
Look at your face.
Do you want to see another handsome face?
Okay ~ Who sees you?
Then what is it?
I see you when I see you.
What are you talking about?
I like it because it's what I want to see.
Hey, am I a mirror? Make you visible ...
Yeah mirror ...
I like it because I want to see it.
Didn't you sleep?
I can't sleep
Heejun?
I sleep very well on the sofa.
Give me a drink too.
Why did you wake up?
... I can't sleep ~
Now baby.
You and me are sick. Don't think about hitting your daughter.
Asshole cub.
When I was in junior high school, I couldn't even say that I was an asshole ...
Is it the same as then and now? Are you my opponent now?
What? The late wind is scary. Is it good? Pretending to be on top of the kids?
good. I'm great ...
Asshole ...
...
When you graduate, they are all kids playing ...
Tell me what I don't know, baby ... before I eat it ~
Crazy bitch ...
Until then, you have to be a crazy dog.
I know you are crazy.
It's good to get attention like this. It's not good to be bluffing in front of the kids. I have never been noticed ...
... asshole ... Why do you care so much?
So ... you?
I'm not ...
Great Baby.
Don't be so hungry that it will disappear ...
But ... even if it's all gone ... I have you. You know my heart, you ...
It's damned.
You knew in middle school. Even if you become miserable among people again ... you only need to know. Then it's done ... then it's done ...
...
...
Hello? Who? Ah ... yes ... good morning. ... Yes, Dad ... Heejun heard this. ... yes ... yes ... now? no. Fine. Okay.
Why did you ask?
...
uh?
Should I ask that way?
...
Why would you call it? uh?
Is Heejun talking?
...
What happened between the two?
I don't know because you're being sold to Jung-soo ...
So you're not asking me to talk?
...
Do you like cleaning a lot?
Huh?
Do you like cleaning a lot?
Why is that suddenly?
Tell me ...
I'm going to ask you for a bit of water, bastard. Why is it bullshit when Heejun calls it up to talk?
... answer me ...
... Why is this sudden?
Do you like cleaning a lot?
Uh ... I like it. Is it okay?
... 
Why is it nowhere to ask? Crazy bastard!
I was just envious and asked. I don't have a girlfriend ... I feel like ...
A fresh guy ...
...
The last time I played with the kids ...
Huh...
At that time, Bokyung confessed to you. Why didn't you take it back then?
How did you know?
I heard from Junghwa. It was good to have a girlfriend now. Besides, Bokyung is pretty.
...
Why didn't you accept it?
It's not my stahl.
It's shit. I don't know your style.
Are you not about my style?
Is it because of Heejun?
What are you talking about?
Right, Byeongshin ...
...
Why is the guy Heejun thought so far? uh?
...
Why is that?
What and why?
Don't be crazy anymore.
...
Fuck it, fuck it.
Even if you were so beaten, can't you get upset? Fuck it!
Fuck that bitch, where do you look! uh?
stop.
Stop and go.
What are you listening to?
I have something to talk to Heejun ... Please step aside.
What song do you listen to?
...?
When someone asks you something, you say ...
What are you saying ...
Just ... nothing ...
...
Is the wound on your face okay?
... Come on?
... Don't be vigilant. I just wanted to talk.
What are you talking about?
...
Let's stop ...
What do you stop?
Just like this ...
When did I have a choice?
Yeah, I'll stop ... So don't do this anymore.
...
I'm sorry...
It's easy to say I'm sorry ...
...
No need to be sorry. I don't want to apologize ...
What are you talking about?
I don't want to apologize to you ...
What? Hey, I'm talking about the rest of my worries ... What is your attitude? uh?
I'm talking too sincerely.
Why are you doing this? uh?
I will transfer next week. Thanks to you ... So I don't really want to apologize. If you didn't transfer, I would accept it because I don't want to be bullied. uh?
...
Are you kidding me? Why are you doing this?
Why are you even doing this? uh? Are you all your children around you?
Have you ever treated me as a good friend? Did you ever think I'd bend in front of you and shake your tail? I know what's the reason for me to come here even when I'm in such a bad shape. Because of that kind of pride you think so important.
...
Same goes for the kids around you right now. Don't mistake me for thinking you're a friend. It's all just next to you because of the sleazy hearing, and no one is your friend.
Hit to hit. Lost without a circle. I don't want to do that when I go to transfer.
What are you doing, crazy bitch!
Don't care, fuck!
What are you doing? uh?
...
Fuck, motherfucker ...
Why are you being a novice to someone else's job, fuck you?
It's annoying, so it goes off to the side.
The fucking motherfucker ...
What?
Do you believe in what you are now?
That's what I say. Gi-tae, you little fool. Where are you close to the topic?
What!? Fuck!
stop.
Leave it alone...
Did you have a meal?
Uh, I ate ... Why are you eating so late?
I had lunch late ...
...
why?
...
Do you have anything you want to say?
Same every day ...
What?
Did you eat or when did you go to school? It's the same thing every day ...
Well, right ...
Is that a conversation?
...
Huh?
That's the conversation ... Then what is it?
Is that a real conversation?
...
Anything you want to tell me?
...
Is there anything you can't say? To me?
... the kids will tell you.
...
Do not worry.
...
Do not worry.
Choose what you want to eat.
Anything is fine.
As a student, can you drink beer?
Yes ... it's okay.
excuse me.
Yes.
Here are 500 beer and a bottle of soju. Please bring your own snacks.
Okay.
I'm sorry to have called you so late.
No ... it's okay.
I'm in high school, but are you busy studying now?
I am preparing for the black exam now.
Did you quit school?
Yes...
... Heejun just visited ...?
Yes ... I'm going to contact my father ... Do you have any things your father is wondering about ...?
I was told that you were closest to me ...
Did Heejun do that?
I've been a friend since middle school ...
drink.
Yes...
When I first started looking for people like this ... I just wanted to know. What was so painful that I couldn't even talk to me ... Why did I have to make such a sudden choice ... It was late, but I wanted to know.
...
But when I heard about Tae-tae, it didn't seem like my child ... I heard about Tae-tae, who I never knew, and thought. How much I know about Gitae ...
...
It's funny ...
...
You were best with Gitae ... I don't care about anything ... I want to hear ...
...
Hey ~
Oh, no way.
...
Are you going to let those bastards stand still? uh?
Yes, let's get rid of it.
When should I see you? uh?
Okay ... just go.
... 
Still, let me say a word.
All right ... Shut up and just come ...
Ki-tae, aren't you too cheap, too?
...
is not it? Why do you act like you if Dongyoon is involved?
What is it like me?
Aren't you the best? Hey, if the other niggas chewed you and passed by, it wouldn't have been ... I wasn't?
... Shut up...
uh?
Don't rush, shut up ...
Heejun.
Does the new school uniform look good? Still, our school uniform looks better ...
Are you telling me to smile now?
... When are you moving?
...
If you move, you won't see it.
It's a gift. Parting gift.
Heejun is very good to transfer
... 
Is it good?
Very cool and nice.
Now I'm a little older and live. I'm in high school if I have a little ... Don't be violent like a child. Are you a kid?
...
Don't shake.
I'm not talking to you.
...
You asked me to stay like this to give you such nice advice ...? Huh?
It's something you think about. It's a friend ...
Yes, thank you. I'll take your advice ... as a friend.
Yeah, dude ...
But there is something I want to tell you too.
What?
I've been worrying a lot about whether to say this or not. I want to do something for you ... But I think I should talk ...
Talk to me. What?
You have cleaning ...
Cleaning ...?
uh...
Washing, why?
Don't meet her too seriously.
...  ... Why?
I just happened to hear what cleaning was like at my school, but it was a little bad ... Remember that day? The day I asked if you really like him ...
...
Originally I tried to tell you this day, but I was worried ...
Don't talk long, just talk.
Hey, I don't think she's the one to meet seriously. When I heard about it, there wasn't anyone in the town who knew Jung-soo. There are so many that even a rough man can count with his fingers. Hey ... what abortion. There was a lot of talk, so I think I moved into this town. Hey, Dongyoon. Don't take her too seriously. Because only you hurt me ...
... What's the reason to come and talk about this now?
Why? I'm talking about you, dude. Shouldn't you be telling a friend this?
...
I was thinking about what to do after hearing this, but when I think about it, I think it's right to tell the truth for you, so I'm talking about it now. I don't want you to be hurt, because it's a request, I hope you don't meet him ... or just meet and think lightly.
...  ... 
... I know you were shocked. by the way...
It's all I know.
okay?
Uh, thank you, but it's something you already know.
I didn't know you knew. thank God. I was really worried ...
do not worry. I'm just meeting for fun.
Yes, dude. You can play a little like that and throw it away.
...
Oh, I was worried again ...
... 
I was worried. I was sick all alone ...
...
Why are you doing today?
Why...? what?
Strange today ... you ...
no. I just had a headache ...
Do you have anything you want to say
What are you talking about?
Do anything you want to say. It's okay ...
Nothing like that ...
I know there is.
no...
Go in quickly. cold.
...
Hey, I have a cold. Go in..
shit.
Why?
Take your watch off for a second.
Why again?
Look fuller ...
What are you doing?
... I want this.
What is it? You know how much I care.
So I wanna have ...
... what's suddenly ...? uh?
I ... You can see this if you take it.
What are you talking about...? Why does it sound weird ...
Then I'll give you this ... This ... Huh?
Okay ... then ... give me ...
Huh...
Go up. late.
Huh...
It's changed a lot from middle school ... It didn't make a big difference. When I came to high school, even though I had never been in the same class, three continued to play a lot ...
...
Are you saying I'm still useless?
No ... it's okay, so keep talking ...
What are the kids?
All the kids are talking about you ...
Heejun hasn't said anything other than that Gitae was close to me?
Why do you ask?
I was just wondering what he said ...
Is there anything that Heejun should have told me?
...
Do not notice. Is there anything that Heejun should have said?
It's not like that.
Don't mind what the kids said ... just relax what you know.
Is there anything you would like to say with your father?
...
May I ask?
... everything is questionable ... Of the two best friends, one of them goes to school, and one of them just quits school ... and no funeral is coming ... I think it might be related to work. It must have happened ... But I feel like all the kids, including you, are hiding ...
...
Am I thinking too much?
...
Do you know why Gitae made that choice?
...
Why?
...
Hey .. why is it like this ..?
Yeah...
come out.
Did cleaning meet?
Cleaning?
Did cleaning meet?
Uh ... I met by chance on the way ...
Did you talk?
What are you talking about suddenly?
Did you tell ...?
What are you talking about nowhere?
Do not ask, knowing. Did you talk to Junghwa?
... How do you see me and ask me something like that? uh?
Answer whatever you ask ... Did you tell me?
Is that what you say to me right now?
Answer me. hurry...
... if I told you?
Kill it.
Kill it. This motherfucker ...
stop...
Stop it!
Stop fucking you motherfuckers ...
What are you doing?
Yes ~ Sorry. We were just trying to help.
Don't be sarcastic ... if you don't want to be ...
Get off, fuck.
Go. Let the two leave.
No way, fuck you ...
Sorry...
Dongyoon, I'm sorry ...
Why are you coming so late ...?
It'll be cold, but you've been waiting ...
Why is your clothes like that?
What's the scar on your face?
Ah, this ... just what ...
What did you do last night?
What are you doing ...?
What did you do?
Should I report that to you one by one?
... Follow me.
Hello there.
What did you bring all of this?
No...
Just come ...
Dongyun is inside, right?
Huh...
Yes?
Wait a minute...
Do you know who did that to Dongyoon?
... Sorry...
do not know?
I'm sorry. I don't know either.
Hey, are you feeling better?
If you're a friend, pretend you're happy.
...
Your body has improved a lot ...?
...
Bored of not going to school ...? I haven't been there since the day you were hospitalized ...
...
It wouldn't have tasted like the hospital, but it's okay to be discharged ...? Still, I will be bored if I am alone.
What is Yong-geon?
...
Just ... I just came to see you.
Just go.
...
Go ...
Dongyoon, I'm so sorry ...
...
Don't do this because it's a favor.
...
Don't do this to me ... huh? please.
...
What should I do? uh?
Just go out ...
...
...
I really don't know ... It's just before I go crazy. But you can't do this ...
Don't be weird ... Go out ...
...
Go out, fuck up ...
Dongyoon, you can't do this to me. As much as you ...
... as much as me?
...
As much as me? What am i? uh?
...
Don't be mistaken.
...
Don't be mistaken ... fuck. I'm not doing this because of your feelings, so listen straight.
...
I'm the only one beside you for a slim reason, you know that I'm a real friend, how much laughter you laughed at when you screamed that I'm the only one who understands? uh?
...
Don't be mistaken that I've been close to you even once. It's disgusting to think so ...
... I'm serious?
You yourself know the best ...
You said you hate pretentious babies like habits. But the funny thing is that you are the most fake. I do not know? How do you speak upright and reverse your actions? That's why kids don't think you're fucking ...
...
Because you're disgusting, the kids around you are leaving. I'm vomiting next to you ... you know?
Is that ... is that what I am?
That's what you are.
What's wrong with how? Huh? What from where ...
There is nothing wrong.
...
What's wrong is you ... I just wish I didn't have you.
Keep going ... keep talking.
... Hee-jun just transferred to school because he couldn't stand those parts. I tried to dry a lot and talked about it. But, again, it came back to me ... in a violent way.
In what way?
You said I was in the hospital before anything happened ...
Are you saying that it was?
Not only me, but all of my friends around me would have been harmed ... All the children your father met ...
... Why are you telling me this? uh?
Your father thinks that things related to me and Heejun are related to the death of Gitae ... But I really don't know. It's not like your father thinks ...
... What were you thinking ...?
I'm not a kid with a weak stance, as your father thinks ... Maybe someone was bullied ... You might have thought that taetae was a victim, but I and Heejun and other children were victims ... We ...
stop...
...
stop...
... Why is Gitae like that ...? Explain to me why.
It wasn't something I could understand ...
...
Just ... cruelly harassing the kids. That's ... that's it ... how can you explain that?
Was it like that? My son?
...
Does my son's best friend look like that monster? I don't understand ...
.. Sorry..
Okay ... I've made a hundred concessions and you're saying my son is a monster ...
...
Why did such a monstrous child choose that?
...
Tell me so I can understand ...
Sorry...
I'm sick of saying sorry ...
... I'll tell you ... No ... Why did Gitae choose that ...
...
Gitae is an introverted and weak-hearted child. I know better than anyone. My son ... but I can't be a great person to bother. That I know ...
...
My son couldn't have done that ...
...
Why are you lying like this?
It's not a lie ... You said your father wanted to hear ... So I told you the truth.
Why are you hiding what you were waiting for?
Nothing to hide ...
The kid who is best with Gitae ... I didn't come to the funeral after I had Gitae. And I quit school ... uh?
Nothing to hide ...
I know there's something else ...
What do you know?
...
Yes?
You were there just before that day. Gi-tae ...
...
Who is it?
I checked out the existing cell phone call list.
I have never spoken on the phone.
Why did you call me like that?
...
Talk to me. Why are you hiding it?
There is nothing to hide.
Do not lie.
...
What happened after you met Ki-tae? uh?
I haven't met ...
Do not lie.
I didn't meet.
Tell me.
Why is this!
What are you doing?
Why are you doing this!
Don't avoid ... Look in my eyes and talk. What happened.
Nothing happened.
Tell me ... what happened ...?
Why are you doing this to me?
Say it!
What do you say !?
Tell me. What is it about? You know.
I don't know, why fuck me like this!
Talk to me.
I really want to blame others. That way I feel relieved and comfortable.
What are you talking about?
It's cowardly. Was it so coward when your mother died?
Do you want to hear that it's not because of you? I want to hear that ..?
...
It's not because of you ... Okay !?
Is it cool? Is it cool?
Is it cool? Is it cool?
Why come now? It's late ... It's late ... Yes? What changes? What the hell do you want to hear? What are you talking about?
That's not ... dude.
What is not ...?
Hey, think carefully. It's not just that ...
You are the problem, man! Don't worry too much. It's good if you like it, and you do it if you want to ...
You're good, baby ...
I'm doing well. Asshole.
Damn it ... Give me the ball!
Why do you care so much, the ball?
... not really...
What is not good? How to understand if you omit all the words before and after ..? uh?
... I received it when I was a child ... from my father.
Give me that ball. Soon it's birthday.
This is no dude.
... baby, you're kidding, why are you sober?
Did I make up?
Yeah dude. Are you crazy and tired?
Oh, it's fucking loud. Ok Eat and fall off.
Really? I really have.
Gimme a baby.
Okay, dude.
When I was younger after receiving the ball, I wanted to play a baseball player.
It sounds like a national batter.
In the final, he hit a home run and said in an interview, 'I will give this glory to my mother in the sky!'
I wear six ...
When I saw it, I thought my father would laugh too.
...
I haven't seen her smile since she died ...
Let's make a laugh after hitting a home run ~
OTC home run. Everyone cheers for me ... Everyone pays attention to me.
