Why is that? There are no notices.
I've got it all.
To that young guy? Do I really have to go out?
Please contact me.
Wait a minute. Put the knife down.
It is an honor to see you.
I... It's no smoking.
Let's go! Colo...
Why do people gamble? Well, you say most of them are thrilling, right? Follow or lose. But really? One day Connie told me. Why people gamble.
What is the first hand?
1. 
This is what the back plate is the boss's destiny. see.
Sakura.
1+3 clean. The boss's fate is clean. By the way... I change my destiny.
1 ding! I only take half the money.
Half?
Is it too cheap?
no. Hehe..
The ones with these motels removed and the ones with reverse motels are very poor. Thank you once today. Ah.. I heard that the workers had to do this once before they sold it.
That's Okay.
Ah~ do you have a lover?
You don't know Connie? It's the best I've ever seen.
Hey, why is it so late? Are you late to save money?
Hey, when the Han River is dry, my money is dry?
A guy with a few inns...
Today we are going to play our niece.
Uh, I brought my nephew today. nephew!
Uh good. Let's take off and sit down quickly. quickly.
Quickly... take out the money... 100 million.. go back. No review, no deception, no upper limit. Ah, the first hand is good.
5,000.
From the first edition? Uncle Don't dry me today. Take 5,000.
The sum is 100 million.
No no don't dry Take 100 million.
Only five?
.. Well...
I'm not so lucky today.
I've only seen the liver... that human... burns.
I can't do it to me, even if I bring a kirk tajja. Please make a fight for tomorrow.
how?
In this order 1.3.5.7.9.
1.3.5.7.9.. 
At the end of the day, that guy will catch 5 dots and I will catch 7 dots. If I give a signal, I pour a drink, and then turn it into a prepared bullet and hide it in the sink hole...
Push 100 million.
Last minute. All-in.
All-in call.
7 ding!
9 ding!
��.
Even if I sit down with a lucky widow, I am fortunate to say that it is an eggplant field. 9 is on the last minute.
Do another bout tomorrow.
Are you selling another motel?
Ah~ To keep the promise, the money will cry, To keep the promise, the promise will cry. Hey~ Let's see it on the wall.
How did you make that mistake?
It's slow to 1.3.5.7.9, so you can't straighten it like an asshole.
1.3.9.7.5.? Oh~
a. Unlucky.
It's a little flowery.
There are no flowers in my flower bed, so I put a flower in my heart.
How are you always late?
Narrow. Go to clause.
There is an appointment there. I have to do a few more days.
I have an appointment. I seemed to have noticed a driver driving a car.
How do you know that?
These things come to the neighborhood and play around. Do you want blood? Would you like to leave money?
I'll ride first. Connie!
Huh.
End quickly. Children's money is not everything in life.
Are you done already?
Bounce.
Money is not everything in life?
It's not wrong.
That's what rich people say. haha
Kkek... But what promise?
... I have to kill one person.
Connie! Let's go too.
Go eat.
Leave it. �� He doesn't come out of his pocket once.
Connie! The boss only buys two boxes of Bacchus.
Yes.
I leave work.
Yes.
Why are you hitting?
Ah~no. I'm so happy, so I'm watching.
You should study and go to college when you're done.
A Chun Jae-hyung, the era of earning money by graduating from college was gone.
If you have money, sit down.
Can I wear it?
Are you not good at fighting?
Ah! Maybe it's hard to get down and come over to shit?
Seotda! You're competing with the numbers by combining the two numbers.
Are you lost? How much are you lost?
I do not know.
It's because I'm just screaming like a crazy bitch.
Hey! Even Haejangguk eats a bowl.
When I lost my money for three years, Connie suddenly felt like I was alone. But what would you do? It's all going through.
Aren't you going to work?
I don't know. And is the furniture warehouse a company?
I'm talking to this uncle. sister! sister!
If a young guy wants to go, go if he doesn't want to go. Beat it.
Beat it.
Child~ How many times?
Don't drink today, come in early. I said that you are coming.
How long will Hyunjung bring?
Never mind.
boss! Did you get some?
a.
What are you saying from Hapcheon?
Park Moo-suk? He also lost 10 million won yesterday. It will be bigger today.
Will the boss also stick?
Life is timing. If you put on only a few feet, your life will change overnight. you are?
No money to eat and die.
Connie! Isn't it hard?
Where?
Burial oxygen.
Do not go anywhere, look at the house. I have money at home.
What money?
My sister is alimony. Business! Let's go to Konya, and let's do business idea between us~
Business idea is over.
No. Connie, you're not crazy. No! With this... if you don't make a mistake...
Peonies June. Siri tree July. Communist month august. Chrysanthemum September. Autumn leaves in October...
What did you eat at that house, so clean?
I've been wearing my wife's pants. Connie, are you all gone?
Child fucker. The feet are not rising. Glimbal... Is it because there is little money? What time is it now?
At that time, Connie decided. If you lose this money, you will end your life!
Connie! When the 8 runs out, raise the plate.
Yes?
I will return your main game.
I'm sick and sleepy. I spilled the soup and dumped the crotch.
There's a game going on.
10 There is no longing because one piece is missing.
What if you lose your hand like that? You have to die quietly.
I made a mistake. Have it.
Nothing... Nothing... Right or right... I've only walked a million won.
If it's off?.. If it's off, it's 1 and 8, but 8 has I.
Two million won more.
Is it 9? I have nothing to underestimate. I just need to grow the plate.
Five million won more.
It's a big plate, so I can't die... everything else.
I'm crazy. Can you eat this? 5 ding!
I am sorry. It is 7 dots.
Wait... Wait 8!
Did you use your grandmother's seat well last year? Thank you grandma! 9 ding!
9 ding? how? Did you do that?
This stupid bastard. There's a little bit here. look. Is it off?
This asshole. Why do you want to take off the stone without leaving the stone?
Misunderstanding misunderstanding. I must have... honored the chieftain.
Who knows as a hug?
Let's speak. Yes? I lost money too.
you! Did you get along with them? What is not?
I've seen these things now. Where does this come from other people's neighborhoods?
brother! Let us not interrupt. You just had to lose money.
Yes, you go first.
No. Get that guy. Catch the scammers...
Connie! You come to my house tomorrow. You're not guilty, but you're going to get some reviews.
What kind of money is this... will you ask or not? Answer me!
Please save me... I'll ask.
when? When will you give it?
I just practiced honoring all day.
sister!
How one~ Let's die!
It's all a coincidence. When Connie was 26 years old. It's all a coincidence. That day, Connie met Park Moo-suk, and Sister Goni brought the alimony from her husband... a frightening coincidence. But a third, more frightening coincidence came to Connie that day.
I'm really... I have to cut off his hand.
Don't say that. What are your hands guilty of?
You speak well.
I'm looking forward to seeing something else when I'm not getting older.
I'm not coming.
Give it steamed?
That's it.
Young man! Are you saying you're going to die?
Let it go.
So why do you hit the shit? Are you flying like Abby? Rumors are over.
I'll die somewhere else, so let me go. Really embarrassing.
Chief Pyeongkyung! How do you do it here? I'm dying now.
Ah~ Leave it here! Otherwise, Korea has too much population.
I have to dry it, though.
Just ask one. Why do you think you lost money?
Why would I have lost it? It's because you're the only one who has been lucky forever.
I'm still wandering around in my dreams, but must I get this body out?
Originally, I decided to remove the stone.
I admitted.
To be honest, he made no mistakes. If he made a mistake, Park Moo-suk? The guy who came from Hapcheon saw his hand, and ah~ This is a twist. Still walking all the money you have?
Park Moo-suk also lost money, right?
This hair is not very good. Chunjae is the money guy? I'm pushing him.
Bodyguard?
It's not anyone's job to beat a person's head. But since Chunjae is pushing, is it out of the ballad? Isn't it strange? Oh yeah! Did you say that when your boss died, a piece of foliage fell? He's also a loser.
Did you just guess?
I'm just sitting there, standing, standing.
Hey Madame! Isn't my hair good?
I have a lot of waves in my life.
Yumma. Anyone have waves? So did you find Hapcheon Park Moo-suk?
I found it.
where?
Up there.
That bastard! How much is it?
It looks like 100 million.
It looks like Go check it out.
Are you... are you... are you crazy? You have to do math mathematically, pushing it into nature.
Let's go.
Big~ Kill it. I'm eating money for money.
Do you know who Oyaji is here? It's Kwak Cheol-yong. Don't you know Kwak Cheol-yong?
Hey~ Our chairman is looking at his face.
What do you think is a handsome face?
Young friends! Money is strong.
What poison is there in less than 200 million won?
Hey. Wow! I have to do it formally.
Today, there is no time, and the original wall is small.
Guys! This person has a small wall. Go behind it and try to keyword it.
No, I... Damn.
Where did we...
Even if you forget the beaten one, you can't forget the right one.
Maybe... Ulleungdo?
It's shit.
Yumma. Can't you catch the President's balls to die? Kwak-cheol-yong is a very famous ten.
.... 
Ugh!
Why?
Urine... Urine is in my hands. This was blown up again. Don't do it.
Because I'm going to do it, you just have to stand behind you like a bodyguard. Grab the weight.
If you get caught up in technology, die here! When you turn around, it's perfect.
Listen carefully to me. I die when I touch my nose and I bet when I touch my lips. Ok?
Don't stop. Let's live like life art.
Life is sublime. Let's go out alive.
Smile, smile.
Hey folding screens! Don't stand stupid and bring some beer.
Indications! Do you know my hand? And a cigarette?
President! Did I eat five consecutive editions? Is it the sixth edition?
Six consecutive wins!
Now it's seven wins.
Wait a minute! Why do you keep your hand in your pocket?
Why is this?
What is this? I want to see this.
That's it. Somehow it didn't make any sense.
What did you say if you cheat? Bring the knife quickly. Cut your fingers.
Don't believe it! Don't believe me! I haven't hidden my passion.
There's an outrage in my pocket, but it's bullshit. Have you seen me take it out of my pocket or not?
... Look at my face and let's do it once.
Let's get this atmosphere... What's so lukewarm?
It's really nasty. it's over. now.
Two thousand more.
Get two thousand and two thousand more.
Getting 100 million more.
Let's do it all.
good.
I got it. 7 ding.
Black~ Is that high?
Eight!
uh? ....
Hey! You should eat a bowl of Haejangguk. If you lose money, it's a trick.
Perhaps? Furniture warehouse?
President! Hats come up from below.
Let people out! Young friends. Look one more time after full moon. I'm a fucking-born guy and I can't live.
Ah~ I'm busy... Boydler said it was. Human attraction is in gambling. See you after full moon.
Sorry. I'll greet you here for today's unsuccessful situation.
Ah~ my mom... my mom should have seen this.
Have a drink tonight and it's just high room.
Let's pick a little more. It is based on water basin.
Kwak, Chul-Yong can't digest the money. If you eat too much, it becomes like this.
anything. Expensive.
Would you like vodka?
How much?
It is 200,000 won.
You don't do that. Expensive and quantitative.
Hey Hwaran! Soothing it is more expensive than vodka. I put money on the table.
Really? A sister! Looks like no money. Sit down and even shave.
12 o'clock! I have to shutter.
I can't do business. So you only pay debts. Give me Johnnie Walker Blue.
Johnnie Walker Blue is a bit expensive.
Let go. If you do, you do it alone. I don't. because? I'm an important person...
It's really love.
Did you see him laughing?
then. He just laughed at me.
Are all the girls in the world laughing at you? �� is just my ��. I'm just beating.
Who has no face and no heart.
Is there... your name?
I am angry.
Should I go to Bukhansan once? Day off.
It is 1.5 million won. Statement here.
Did you see? It's just a date request.
Did you refuse?
Huh. Ah~ winter is over. I am so sad that I want to die.
It was revenge on Park Moo-suk. He? With this, I'm telling Kwak Chul-Yong~
Do you think I was aiming for Park Moo-suk?
Then who? Kwak Cheol-yong?
no. The guy behind Kwak Cheol-yong.
You?... why?
this! Don't let me know my house.
Please accept me as a disciple.
Tuition fees?
Give me your hand.
No. You don't learn Hwa-too. .
Hey! If you make money in Korea, you must buy land. Buying an apartment in Gangnam.
Teacher! Me, my sister, I can't hold my legs until I pay back.
If you want to die like that, take drugs instead. Hwatu is a sad drama. Oh~
There is no longer a crude life.
It is medicine that I do not know at all.
Knowing is the power.
Bother... Are you confident I don't blame?
Yes.
no. You will definitely blame me. The character looks like that.
I don't blame.
you! Even if you think about it, are you feeling weak?
no. I'm a tough guy.
Would you like to be beaten to death by that man?
.. why?
Did you lose money for a reason, dude?
Hey
I?
Are you good?
What are you? Did the vice president send you?
do not know. Are you good at it?
Oh, what about me? .. call the police.
If the spirit of report is too strong, the agar will tear like Lee Seung-bok. Sell fruit.
Are you now a disciple?
Heohe can you kill someone?
Yeah?
I was beaten to death, so I have to beat it.
Fighting doesn't work.
Tazza's first principle. Be cruel!
Hey brother! That's when I saw it. Did you learn boxing?
What are you again?
I have to run round two.
Will you tell me how to speak?
I see will, but... I think I've been hit too much.
Saying yes.
Do you want to learn like that?
Yes.
Hwatu is a horse. If you pick it up like this, you need to know how many. Chapter 8. look.
This is chapter 9.
Uh... I can't. That's it. Hold on to the fight. Beginners hold it like that. We hold it like this.
You can't fall. Fingers. I tie it up and practice. So, when you hit it, you can feel it.
From this morning. Cook.
Yes-e.
I'm old because I've been resting for 3 years.
I can see everything. It's basic on the palm of your hand.
telephone.
Leave it.
What is the ranking of the teacher in Korea?
Of course I'm the first place
A~
Uh~ laugh, you kid. suspicion? When fighting, there are only three in Korea. Even in Gyeongsang-do. I don't like Jeolla-do. And nationwide! In the past, a pair of ears and a pair of ears were attached, but the angler cut off the ears. So it's unrequited.
So, did the teacher have an attachment?
You asked well. What is your lifelong wish? Is it the unification of the motherland? no. It's my arm. Look. Are you fired? Yes? The angler is still looking for me. That's why you need to know that, who am I? It's a water island where I'm a fighter and I'm a fighter. It's full of souls. Yes? Huh!
Why does such a person live in a house like this?
Why if I buy the land, the price only drops there?
When will you tell me about Hwatu?
Kill that bitch and come.
Why is that?
Let's run round six. It's hard for me too.
You did well. Lay out moderately and then discharge.
That's not... I'm going to die.
This kid is going to hit me.
I said, "Well, I'm going to lose it properly."
okay?
How many seotda do you have?
Chapter 20.
So, this world is twenty. Come in.
Mix the swat and pull it out, then, while striking, put the plucked hand underneath...
Mix it alone, honor it alone, and you're all alone.
So, while turning the hand, the teacher's hand that I decided to knit today is taken from the bottom. In this case, the teacher's hand is 9 and 10, and it is 9 clean.
So you mean this is 9? Where shall we turn it over?
It's long!
That hand?
Why hands?
How did you do it?
Tazza's second principle! Hands are faster than eyes!
What hand do you want to hold? Pick it.
1 drop.
Is 1 here and here?
I'm playing the piano. With your fingers. Hwatu is here. Card here. I know while folding. Hit eight, hit eight, hit four. Then again 1. I will find it even if you hit it.
Shall we pull 1?
how?
I folded it and pressed it with my nail. a little. 0.00001 mm. Super-precise hand feeling. Yes? Huh! I'm here now. I have a sense.
The hand is not spying. I just know.
In the winter of that year, Pyeonggyeongjang and Connie went on a road trip around the countryside. So Connie was becoming a hitter.
A father. Are you not going?
Huh? Yes... I have to go. Let's stop. Half left.
What do you eat if you give half or Ep?
Hey! Those people also have to live. The Third Principle! Don't be greedy.
It's going to be cruel.
S... Do you care for me? Ugh! Like flowing water. And dude. You say uncle, so what is your father?
I'm sorry.
See you in a long time.
I'm busy. Do you live with this?
What at this age.
Heohe shouldn't live like that. If a woman doesn't, she gets sick. how? Should I volunteer?
It's cool.
You can boil it again. What do you see? Eat mine.
Is it over then?
awhile.
Dynamic. 40,000 boxes. Hold on 300 million.
Close the door. cold.
Eight? It's over. I go.
You are good at fighting.
Lose money and increase your painful experience.
Are you going to carry heavy money when you are old?
So I brought a young friend.
He's a young guy, learning life while being beaten. Hey Lee!
Are you from the police? I used to be wearing a captain before. Fourth rule! There is no safe gambling board in this world. Don't believe anyone!
Can I go now? I leave Dong-tae.
Are you okay?
Uh? I can't sleep comfortably. How many homes have I left behind... punished. This guy... this wild boar keeps coming out in my dreams.
Anyway, you dreamed of a pig, would you like to play a million won seotda with me?
Look at this... Shall we hit him? Shall we use natural bread?
Will I be Gura? You should beat it with natural bread.
Are you confident in natural bread?
Lucky.
Are you still looking for luck on the gambling board? Cover the line. Day and night.
We used to bite our fingers in case we heard someone, but it seems like they must listen.
one million won!
Do you want to finish it in one bout?
If you're scared, die.
good. one million won.
Is it long?
Yes.
It's Nimi 9.
Can you stop fighting if you recover the money you lost?
...You must earn five times.
If you can't quit, you're cutting your fingers.
Yes.
Okay, it's Pyeonggyeongjang... Let's see it in Busan.
Who are you?
you! Do you know who the gambling flowers are?
Wait.
It's been a while.
Well..
Shall we talk about things first? I retired with two stars called O Janggun, but I have a lot of money and I'm a real gambler. Without skills, it's fast.
So you need a hitter like me?
I missed you.
Heohe... Gura has increased.
Who are you? bodyguard?
Goni, I'm going to play as a player tomorrow. I hold the wind.
Are you so good?
I like the ride.
It just looks gentle.
Gentle is Niimi. He asked me to play a true story, and he scared me off and gave me 9 dots.
Did you know you gave me 9?
Hey! The sound is different when the bottom is removed! Sound!
You've heard and let go of this person.
Shall we look at the snow? How many chairs are in this room?
chair? ... eight
Five.
Up to three unused chairs over there.
Who do you think I am?
I don't think I can hit.
How do you know?
Because my hands are soft.
And again?
Lonely.
Ho Ho. I know well.
It's hot.
How have you been lately?
What would my life be like... would it be like a lonely sailboat? Because we live by artist concept, we are. So you hate me?
Yes. I hate you.
Heohe... What if I rub my nose?
Die unconditionally!
Touching the lips?
Raise money!
When you have a shoulder?
Shoulders 1. belly 2. knees 3. biting lips 4. sighing 5.
Are you close to Jung Ma-dam?
It was a little fun for me. Ah~ Flower is good. What do you see that?
3
You are going crazy too.
Don't you have a drink?
Drink and come in.
Who is it?
Uh huh~ Life is like a flower. Nimi.
I came later than I thought.
It's not like that.
okay? suit..
Didn't you go?
Let's have a drink.
It's not like that. Like this... like this. What do you think?
It looks like a damp flower.
Yes... like this. Good.
Eight. How to see a man.
Pyeongjangjang? I want to erase it from memory.
The two of you might have been together.
Hoho... funny. Do you want to make your own money?
I want to earn.
It will be fun if you work with me.
Pyeonggyeongjang?
Street life. It went well long ago. Then what are you doing? It's dog hair right now. If you work with me, you ride a BMW.
BMW... what is it...?
Hoho... So, what about Hermes?
Uh~ it's heavy.
Can you do well tomorrow?
My tips! Excite your opponent. Heh
A thousand more.
Listen carefully.
Take it all. 1 ding!
One drop, three.. Thank you.
Doesn't this guy have an abby? What did you say now?
Why do you do that?
Didn't you just tell me to wake up?
Who told you to stop General? I told you to lose it.
Isn't that what you mean?
Let's not do that one. Where would you go and gamble with this? Hey there, let's suck our beer.
Don't sing!
why?
I care.
A lot of people don't do this. It's Park Jeong-hee.
8 is bad. No genealogy was created, and at best it was 8 clean. But when 8 comes out again... no. I can't go...
8,000
Didn't you see the second hand?
Just feeling. If you get shot in the head, follow me. If you say you were shot in the head in front of the general, it's Sillian. I will correct you, General.
Good. You catch me.
Um... I don't have enough... Can you accept this...
There's a bullet. Are you okay?
Please accept. Close up.
7 ding.
Wow! Whoo~
General I think today is over.
Wait a moment! Go to the safe in my store and get some money. Let's wait only 10 minutes.
At that time, I knew what my feelings were for Connie. love? Well... including that... I want to have it! I want to have that human... The man who went out came back in 3 minutes. It was promised.
If you make a sound, you die. Don't crack your fingers!
What is it? Fists are waiting in the next door.
General! Originally, the bottom of the lamp is hot.
I know you've got it, and I'll save your life.
Suckle! Weak. Put one more.
saw? Yes?
Why aren't you talking? Are you angry?
Why didn't you tell me how to play a child?
I was going to surprise you. It's fun.
I am not a fun gambling person. Give it to Connie.
what?
Lump. People like us should stay away from that.
Don't go.
If you are next to a sinner, you will be thunderbolt together.
I don't know who is the sinner.
Huh! Aren't you going?
What is the probability of 8 dots coming out there?
6.4%. 1/16.
You are writing. Tajja doesn't even bet on 99%. Cut one finger with this.
why?
I have to keep my promise. You paid five times for your money.
..... 
Technology is a waste?
no.
What are you laughing at?
Are you angry? ... Would you bet? You can't cut that.
Anyway, everyone will take care of your finger and cut it. Just leave it. Hurry...
who are you?
Sigil, what is it?
Yes fuck. You have to listen to the sound of being nailed to the lid of your life. Let's turn over.
Are you still alive?
Don't worry Because someday it's all dead.
I have to cut my hand. Is today that day?
There will be a good day.
Long...
Who are you?
angler fish!
angler fish?
Didn't you cut it?
I've been thinking, uh... this is what I can do well.. uh.. If I was born as a man, wouldn't it be necessary to step on the accelerator?
Do you know why I don't work with the woman? The woman is a pretty knife. Touch carefully. The more and more women become scared.
Chief Pyeongkyung! Even if I see you later, I will keep my righteousness.
There are no eternal friends on this floor. This is the last rule! Go~
I will live with art of life.
Please do it in total. From shoes to wallets.
One big page is over.
Didn't you hear me?
Ah yes.
I will drive.
listen. This engine sounds. Kill it. It looks like a horse just before running.
Shall we step on it?
I can't ride it because it's cold in winter.
Hohoho...
I go in and there is 10 minutes.
Oh my i'm too fat
Isn't that so original?
Yes.
Doesn't Jeong Ma-dam have been around for a long time?
Ask your sister.
Now 20%. What are you going to do with this money?
Secret.
oh hwa-tu? this way. 
Can I get it if I open seven? Another seven? Wairano has broken hands. Ah, come on, Johnny Walker, Hannah. Blue Blue~
Wow? Isn't it hot?
Goma Haiso. The same technicians.
He didn't have a few skills.
Technicians look at technicians and say...
Let's stick with technology. Sounds fun.
fun? Wow. I've been smacking it for half a year, but a man came and took a look. What are we talking about?
Let's eat and eat. We also have a fever. Say hello to Jeong Madame.
Chateau Margo is 84 years old.
Is it the most expensive here?
Yes. And I hate that girl.
Go back and talk.
There is no border in front of money.
What��s your job?
What? What? Job! Job... I am.. gambler. Korean best.
nice man. 
Why did you go there yesterday?
Where are you?
US military forces.
It's a ghost. By Bored. Does it have a big size?
Don't go to other boards. If the floor is sold, you can't get a job. If you don't get a job, your life is over
Put on that. Connie is purple. Today's baldness will make the plate bigger.
How much money does the professor have?
It's the hospital hospital.
What are you doing? professor!
Let's see the result.
It's not very high. 8 clean.
Whoo~ It's a difference.
professor! Go to the next room and have a cup of coffee. Flow chart by the way.
I wonder...
Git brother! I'm losing my daughter.
Churchill... Didn't you get the Churchill Nobel Prize for Literature? When Churchill ended World War II,
Then I'm going to ride my cock endlessly. Touch mine. It's different if you touch this.
Good! Good!
How much is left? Let's push it all.
It's about 100 million... Let's see.
4 ding.
I played well.
Mister! I have to pick it up.
So much?
professor! When I appear again on the battlefield, I die.
Yes. thank you.
Pick a lot.
No one can stop him now. You know. So did Connie, and so did I.
Did Jeong Madame ever have that?
Why not?
Looking for Connie!
I? Hello... why me? .... died? Can I check it out now?
You bitch.
What days are you going to be doing this?
I should have been there then.
I go to work from tomorrow.
If you drink.
OK? Oh~ I was really worried. With human emotions.
I knew who killed Captain Pyeong.
.. Who?
angler fish!
angler fish?
Please put a plate with the angler.
No. If you hit it, you're all dead.
Attach it with the angler. What are you doing? Let's go for money.
At that time, my heart was full. I think Connie will die someday. And I knew that when the time came, they would leave me. But the day came sooner than I thought.
Is it Ding? Is it Ding? ...Right or wrong! It's Niimi. do not know! Eat it. Are you fighting? Hit with money.
Let's do it quickly. I don't have time to earn money...
I scream with money.
If you are scared, you die. If you're scared, don't get married.
Confirm!
Did you spit on the canvas? Why not. I won. Haha, did you eat with this hand? Kwang-ryeol Maybe this society still has justice.
Frenzy~ Take one high one. Today you will be nice. Let's get all the money here and buy a used car. Used cars Used cars! Ugh~ Ho! number!
Let's shut up a little bit.
Are you a daughter? It's fun.
die.
I eat again? Chuck
Can I put 10 million won?
You get it?
Why is this like this? Newly.
The accusation came in, so we are. Went in a few days.
I'm a woman from here. How to get into that Dell.
Jung Madam! Look at me. You know it's hard, right?
In a word, I was crushed by Kwang-ryul Ko, my brother. Why do I need a bodyguard? If you think I'm going to tell you, um... you shouldn't reveal your identity...
What is your identity?
Only my brother knows, I'm Tajja.
what?
Taj.. Taj! ... Tajja! ��~.. I used to play at a hotel in the old days. With the second generation. It was good then. They lose money decently.
.... Once I pay back my money from 10 million won.
What 10 million won?
Previous version. Because I stopped.
A~ I didn't play. Shall we hit it again now? Huh? Okay~ I have nothing to say. It's a 10 million won version. character! If you cut it from mine, it's 3 dots. You're probably one.
I gave you one.. are you... are you a hitter too?
10 million won.
This is invalid.
Horse number three is first-come. There is nothing to see.
Eight times?
It's number three.
It was Eight. I've been thinking about it, and if you combine your mystery with mysterious skills, we seem to be walking small businesses. As I cruise around Faldo, I eat the hukou, the other hitters, the woman, and... I think it's going to be a little bit better with you.
I'm not interested.
Hey! life? It's a network!
If you meet the Tajja, can you meet the devil?
Without luck.
Are you worried? I'm going out soon.
I'm Seoul.
Seoul?
Going to the world and looking for an angler.
Why, like a child. There is no evidence that the devil did it, and you can't win by sticking with it.
Why is this? You know how to lose.
Listen to me Beat it. It will become famous. Then who will stick with you? What are you going to live with?
I don't do gas stations in the countryside Good. I'm getting married.
Then it's not with me.
Jung Madam! Do you love me?
......... You are my family. I'll see you again. I went well.
Yay bitch! Better than that. I'm calling from bread. Who haven't you loved in the past? Don't you distract me quickly instead of a dog form magazine? What do you want?
Do you know what love is?
She fell.
Later... I knew later. I wasn't sending Connie to Seoul, but would we have been happier?
wake up. It's not because I hate you.
Yes.
Yes. Uh.. Uh.. go there. I can't wait to solve it myself... What are you doing today? It's no big deal. I just lost a little... What do you mean?
This is a shame. It's all rumored and Hugh!! Get down again. What am I going to be when you are? Phew!! Let's go home and have a drink.
I think it's crackdown. At 12 o'clock.
Why does this country stop drinking after 12 o'clock?
Who?
I have a chairman.
Hwaran is coming, and I'm in the mood for a drink.
Yes?
You are long It's not crackdown. You can go and have it.
Shh!
How did she borrow money from a human like that?
It seems to be prettier. Sit down.
Please tell me only the matter.
Do you think you're bothering you for the money I lent you?
I will pay the debt.
You don't have to pay back!
Mr. Hwaran Today, our chairman was hurt by two weird guys... You know, look like our chairman's boy. Please sit down.
Does the bully get hurt?
Wow! Go out and sing a song. Uh, you thought I was a bully. I am not a bully. I just lived for a while when I was young. I lived by virtue of it, but when I talk about something like this, but... Heo-heo, Kwak-cheol-yong of the world also pours red gold.
Do you really pour red gold?
Hwaran-ah, I'm pure. However, if the chastity is trampled, then you will be a thug. Would you make me a bully? Should I kidnap you?
I'll go when I'm done talking.
Where are you going?
I thought the child was cracking down.
Why are you here?
I've got a drink, so I have to drink.
This twenty-armed world is narrow. Do not splash
Why should I get paid? Ah, Mr. Hwaran, if you don't like it, let's watch a movie. 'Rosy life', but Choi Jae-sung comes out. Tomorrow... Keep singing. let's go.
He's a really strange person.
Is there any strange person in the world?
Are you supposed to watch a movie?
It comes out hard.
Do you have a heart?
Crazy?
Can you win again? Isn't she the size laugher than you?
To win.
If you lose again, you become a metamorph.
Yes.
I wear it on the wall.
Hwaran is my partner.
I don't. It's pure simam.
I'm just gathering Gangnam aunts in Damju, I'm going to have fun and go to Incheon.
My brother hangs out with my aunt.
The ladies are cleaner. Honestly, when they sleep, the land price rises and the apartment price rises. We need to be in good mood, relieve stress, and be nice.
How much do you think I will get to Kwak Cheol-yong?
do not know. I can not hear you.
Should I win 2 billion?
I can't hear you... 2 billion? In the old days, my grandmother came to the store and told me to sell Hanjae.
It's like that.
come. Wow, that's nice.
Isn't that stolen?
sister! We're trying to make them regular, not dating.
Okay
And don't tell me you're a kid.
What do we do? I think I'll start with that.
It's okay to lie like that.
You have to be responsible for sales today.
okay.
Movie is not fun. Ah~ Let's go see Mr. Hwaran's house.
Is Connie a flirt?
Of course.
I... I have to tell you first,
what?
I have a child.
Ah? how old?
I'm five years old.
Your father?
Dead. I thought it would be too hard to throw it away...
You can't throw it away. Kids. If you throw away your child. What happens. Become like me. Huh?
So I don't throw it away and grow well.
Well done. Seran is great. Shall we kiss?
Yes?
Lonely people.
We go out too.
why?
I don't think I came to the movies.
Ha! I'm having fun with the movie.
How much is the debt?
many.
I will pay you back.
why?
I want to.
What are you doing now?
It's a kind of betting.
I saw the wrong person. Do you know what love is?
love? Isn't it all love anyway? This is important.
Connie? You and Kwak Kwak are the same man.
What's so complicated... damn bitch. Why is it so pretty?
You can't do this.
You can't do this. I know, I know.
Wait.
Yes, I'll hold on
I really can't. I didn't know I was a gambling person.
I'm going to hang up.
Really?
It's real.
I think it's angry. Hide it.
Date?
It's kicked Sister?
I? I just broke up.
Well done. Honestly, I can't see his hairstyle. Will someone who doesn't love hair love a girl?
Why are you kicked?
It's too intoxicating, it's too poor, and I know it's cool.
You like him because he is cool.
When did I?
You did it to me last night.
Until yesterday evening. In my mind. My sisters are people who are struggling.
Really? You can hang up.
If you're a really cool guy, I'll quit.
Dad?
Huh? Mister? Let's sleep. Who is you...
Dad?
Shhh!.. Yeah, it's Dad.
Dad~
Mom! Dad is here.
where?
Where do you want to go?
Jeonju.
Jeonju? What are you going to in Jeonju?
.... 
But the fare will be quite reasonable until Jeonju... I just got out of school and I won't have any money. Huh?
My father earned a lot of money from a coal mine in the Japanese colonial era, and at that time, I couldn't go through this place in Iri, Gunsan, Jeonju.. All three of my sons went to bed and fell asleep.
What did your three sons sleep with?
It's gambling.
Hey lady! Hey
Me?
this this
I'm sorry. Did I?
Wipe it off?
That's it. Work out nicely.
Sorry what?
It's expensive, but throw it away.
It's really... it's killing her.
continue.
I'm proud to say that I'm a self-respecting, enthusiastic, sports enthusiast, and fifty-two-year-old in his early forties.
I don't see how old I am.
Honestly, except I'm coming, it's Shichende, one day, a good day, and looking at the sky. I have to live for a long time~ What do I do if I pile up money and die early... I haven't had a workout since then. Tennis swimming golf. Are you good at golf?
No, I haven't gotten 100 shots yet.
I have to go until the play. You didn't meet the teacher well.
boss! When did you play golf? I'm sick again today.
He goes to fortification. Make up there.
Are you struggling with your own fortress?
I just hit it a couple of times.
Jaesu! There is no one who can't make money with gambling-loving human beings.
Property is 10 billion, but it is almost real estate. Three buildings. 15 boats. There is land.
The fortress set up a company called Seohae Development and went to and from Gunsan, Jeonju.
So there is no cash?
Yes.
okay!
The boat is 5-6 thousand per chuck, so buy a farm license. When it comes to fishery compensation, even if there are documents, it's 200-200 million won per sheet. Fortress Jeollabuk-do ticket cafes, even if they move their resident registration to Gunsan, eat 500 each.
I don't know why Saemangeum.
Originally, I made money when I was upset Get ready for the 500 president. Yelim! Relax.
What if I don't go in?
Why doesn't it work? Even if I just wear a farting ball in front of the ball, I will go in.
Oh.
No How can I not put it? That's just muff- real. Is there no exercise sense? Really... one more turn before it rains.
Please drop me off here.
Are we angry?
Is 5 million won so precious?
It's not a waste of money, but I bet anyway. If I lose, I can't sleep.
Really... too much. I am a person, but I can make mistakes...
Is this really.. really crying? I'm a bad guy
Sorry. In anger.
no no. Yelim!
Call Ho-gu that he thinks he's going to have a fight tomorrow. So, let's go together in the market. So sit on the plate. Just lose two days. Three thousand each. After paying 6,000, he unravels the bowl so he doesn't hit each time he drives. Don't be too tight.
Yes.
Do it well. You have to hit it quickly and get out. The money here will dry soon. It's starting to fall out.
Jung Madam! When do we go to work?
Next monday.
Here is Daemai technology from Daejeon.
Let's see.
Show me.
Send it for the car. The technology is good, but the mask is bad. People are wary. The mask is good for Goni.
I only know that I asked the Seoul Raccoon to find Park Moo-suk.
Look at the raccoon and ask me to call you.
It's hard to eat and live.
Gangnam ladies are gathering? Closer here.
I'm stressed. let's go.
Uh... Go alone today. You can't go to Ebi Ebi.
Dad~
Huh. Did you play well?
Why dad? Hey! This is not your father.
Why are you doing that? Cry. Play in the dirt.
Isn't it pretty?
Huh. I go alone.
It's all hukou, so dap!
This biting taste~ I put five hundred.
Put it in? I'll spread it out with a cloth. Hohoho.
After returning to the house without a sacrifice, what is this? Put it together.
die.
Seasoned I'm sick, but I die?
die.
It dies even though it is 5? What is this human.
Somebody hold the line for me.
Where are you going?
It drains a little.
When I drain the water, it falls off.
Let's lie down together.
I don't think there is any skill. Try twisting it with a low hand. Seven I am eight.
Yes, no. I have to stand again.
I pee and start with a basic cloth.
I should. I'm just excited. receive.
This lady is interested in our spirit world. That would be fine.
It's good to be fine.
Get a thousand... five thousand more.
It gets cold. I die.
It's too bad to be Park.. I'm dying.
Let's go It's about 100 million.
It's good.
Eight!
I'm 7 dots.
Where did that 7 ding come from? I definitely gave it seven.
Let's take a break. Why are you staring?
Did you taste the pebbles and then blow an apartment?
It was exciting. I feel like I'm going somewhere. Would you like to go out and drink a young friend?
I'm going to bring you more money, so let's do it again.
You see. I paid off everything.
It's not daughter again.
Then pay it back... pay it back... you can't. Learn more.
What's wrong? Who are you? Huh?
Kill it I'm going to die like this anyway.
Even?
Sorry. I didn't know you.
Drink alcohol.
I changed the seventh to 7 dots.
You are good too.
What I want to ask is how do I know the other person is going to hit the Gura?
I have to read people's hearts. Hwatu is not a hand. It's a heartbeat.
How do you read the human heart?
I don't know. Heh... But look at my eyes when you run down. Never look into the other person's eyes when you run down.
Seniors! Can I win if I meet the angler?
My ear was cut because I was using technology, and was it cut off because I wasn't using technology? You will be like this soon. Huh~ I'm sorry.
Where are you going?
Let's go anywhere.
Anywhere? Arboretum? So is it offshore?
Yes. anywhere.
That's Okay. Here you go.
Yes? Anywhere here?
The world is small.
You've been struggling all night, right?
Well.
Have you made a lot of money?
I lost it. Would you like a drink?
But why are you stepping on someone's back?
Ha~ Are you caught?
Then, sitting in the back, ��the world is narrow��, that��s also the end.
I'm sorry at that time... I'm different from my heart.
That's stupid~
Really not drinking?
... Would it be funny if I said this?
Tell me.
I have to shave my hair.
It smells like alcohol.
Sorry.
Some talent is good.
Rumors spread. It was Kwak Cheol-yong's last time. I'm going to stick again.
Is mayonnaise in your head? If Kwak Cheol-yong blows, I can't work anywhere in Korea. Connie, my sunsoon, why didn't you tell me? Can I ignore it?
I'm not ignoring... Fortress Moo-Seok Park is Cheol-Yong's leading player. That's why I only wanted Park Moo-suk.
How much did Connie hit?
About four.
Don't let Goni reconnect with Kwak Cheol-yong.
I have gained some weight.
It's a ghost. Sit down.
done. The chair looks uncomfortable. I have something to ask Connie.
It's already a burden.
I started construction in Gunsan, Jeonju, but there are no technicians. I think it would be great if you came with Connie and Kwangryul. Hello, teacher.
Ah yes.
Pay is 10 times higher than Busan!
Wow... I have a fat purse too.
Connie! The meal is ready, hello.
Yeah-. who?
I am a lover.
uh!
I've heard a lot.
Really? How far have you heard?
But it's fatter than it looks
Ho-ho This woman is hard to control.
Well, is love control?
But the fashion sense of the fortress has fallen. The shirt is so plain. It's the hotel's contact information.. Contact me if anything happens. See you again, lady.
It looks like a fox.
Young crab. Look at what you say.
How much do you owe me?
It��s 3,000.
I'm not going to get it, so I'm going to get some tea and go to Jeonju.
Really?
Seoul... wait a month. I come again.
Connie, let's just jump.
I'm dead when I die, I can't run away.
It's you, but why me. Are you doing this because I like it or not?
Let's be quiet. I'm going to water it with a couple wrapped knife.
The couple... what do you want me to do?
What about Seran?
So does her... Her name is Hee-yeol, and I'm mad.
Shh!
What is so amazing?
Then what about Kwak-cheol-yong?
Butting grows. Either Kwak Chul-yong or me.
Goni there
Do you do it or not?
How much is falling for me?
20% 
Connie!
You've got it.
Connie!
Why?
We don't have enough money.
Know.
Tomorrow Kwak Cheol-yong will take the medicine from him. Don't drink
A. Give me a towel there.
awhile. Come here, Wuxi.
Yes.
5 million!
10 million more!
50 million more!
Let's sum to 100 million.
okay? The sum is 400 million. If you're sarcastic, you're dead.
Is it high...?
Not high.
If it's high, we have to suck it again. 400 million.
I die.
Check the money.
Seems right.
I'm afraid.
First, let's cut it.
Long!
uh? ... I'm too long.
a! I'm not hitting forty sheets.
Should we put this on and turn it over again?
Turn it!
'Clean? How much..'.. how much is left?
100 million.
Push it in.
Do you accept checks? 500 million.
You have to use it! Call the bank.
I have only this cash today.
Whether it's a building or a collateral.
.... Well...
Chohung Bank? I'm going to do a check check... I'll call you the number. 4533...
a. Dead. What are you?
Clean? Clean?
I will use this money for good.
.... Any thoughts of coming under me?
How do wolves go under the dog?
You don't have the ball to see. I'm going to the room, so call me and call me.
Yes.
awhile. Shut your mouth.
... There is a traitor inside. This is my conclusion.
I am not.
okay? Prove it with this. If you can't prove it, you'll get ten fingers off.
I will prove it.
Would you believe me now?
Trust me? Why does a man who is innocent cut his finger?
Where are you supposed to meet? Huh? ..... where?
Why isn't Park Moo-suk coming? Did you get it?
It would be okay because it is fast.
Ah.. I'm not urinating.
brother! Wait at the store. I will be here.
I wonder.
brother!
Why?
Would it be fun if I lived with Hwaran?
Break this?
Huh.
You have a good personality.. you will live well.
.... Hwaran? Change your brother. Quick... Brother! I rode a daguri. Bounce.
Seran! I definitely come back.
Take it.
You are long.
Hwaran is here.
With money?
Isn't that the case?
Case.. In the end, in the case of the world, we all live in violation, but we have to take another case. But it's strange in this case. Isn't it my money? No show party.
Where are these fifteen splits? If there are long people, they will live quietly in the long road.
I will work for you.
Are you a wolf?
I wanted to live like the meat I met with water, but it's fish on a cutting board.
Do you believe this guy?
You have to use it! Can you bet on your life like a bet?
Me? ... of course.
Hahaha.. call me... how about the money?
I hid it.
Wait for the car. Release the two little girls... Just release.
The guy who was with you. Glasses jab.
Where are you?
I have to find it.
If you find it?
I started my life as a seventeen. If you hit 100 people who started crossing at that age, I'm the only one living as much as I am now. How did I get here? The good guys, the bad guys, the family members, the betrayers... killed.
.... 
I like you because you have a lot. Show me that.
Can I show you now?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yes... I'm sorry.
Organize here and do it like this? Block that window. Don't you know there's no window in the department store? Would you like to fight while watching the sun rise?
Good. You don't have to answer. But three times already, it's really... faith! That's important.
I'm angry?
No, I'm not angry. You don't have to ask... Can you meet another man?
That's not it.
Then why not come out... Huh~ I'm not angry.
That day... no.
Talk to me. that day?
I was fighting.
Are you... gambling? What?
Seotda.
Seotda? .. haha kill five. What do you do?
I did it with my hands and feet, but if I just grab a hand, it's like... blood circulation and ugh~ I'm crazy.
Is gambling bad? It is gambling to buy people. Are you lost? Um... will I get revenge?
Don't wear it. They have a lot of money
Hwatu is unlucky. The luck is seventy-five percent and the momentum is thirty-fronde. Are we playing golf? A few days ago, when I hit Sutda with a gnome, I got a 6,000 plate, which is a 5 drop in the first pitch. 5 is not good. But for some reason, it seemed that the sense of sticking to my hand would drop 5 again. The next hand comes in. It's five. Ah~ Then I feel...
Let's go to the basics. cloth.
I was ambiguous at this time. Three thousand.
The Bible says that this edition should go unconditionally. Five thousand.
It's O-Ring if you get 5,000, but you shouldn't worry more than 3 seconds. receive.
I'm telling you to die. Did you catch Ding?
Can I ask two more? 2 ding.
5 ding.
What should I do? Six drops.
Joy is also cruel. This is already O-ring. It's early evening.
What should I do? The lucky year is that even if you sit down, you sit on the top of the river, and if you fall down, you fall into the eggplant field.
Let's do it quickly. But how did you bring it with you to hold this night with 5,000?
There is no review.
Can't you borrow some of the money here?
Is this the house? There's a tail.
Call Yerim.
Stop the boss.
I'm calling.
Have you lost everything? Don't do it.
No, there was no cash on the way to today. Do you have the money you found you'd give the store owner tomorrow? Did you say 100 million?
I only found five thousand.
Five thousand? ... that's okay. I'll send Mr. Kim right now...
Usually, the hukous think that they are losing money because of lack of capital. Lend only half of it so that you feel strong. Hukou loses money. The money comes back to me and lends the money back to Hogu. No one has actually won money. Money just turns and turns. Repeated several times like this, the debts of Hu Gu blow up like a pile of mountains. Then I finally finish off.
Do you know how much money you have already borrowed?
It's because you're not lucky. I'm still picking it up, and Joey's catching up on the last three times. Okay, lend me one more time.
It is already 1.5 billion. One billion of them is Daladon... if you can't pay the money, it's okay, but my life is over. Please be mindful... please...
It's really the last time.. I'm going to secure one of my buildings, so let's borrow 2 billion more. Huh?
Would you like 2 billion? If I look at the building anyway, I'll try up to 3 billion. So why don��t you pick it up?
right. Gambling is a wave. If you go down, you go up.
Playing. It's you who dies.
Do you have any news for Connie?
hospital.
I should send you a bunch of flowers.
Are you a lover?
The nurse was sprained.
Let's see. Is it a lover?
'The construction is going well. One building is over, and now we are going to build a second one. Mr. Kwang-ryul is showing his skill, but maybe Connie should come and do the finishing work?' What is this? Connie, are you building?
What if you give me something?
The owner of the flower is separate.
Someone was good.
He told me not to fight in the hospital.
GoStop is also a doctor. Hey Connie! Where?
He didn't pay for the construction.
Oooh, I'm Goni, I have to kill the baby.
Welcome.
It's been a long time since you.
How are you?
I have some money that Cheol Yong borrowed from me. Didn't you tell me that before I died?
There was no such thing.
Siberian. You can't kill twice.
It's a sibling. Did you talk to our chairman now?
You went to the hospital yesterday to pick him up? Did you pick me up?
You have to get revenge.
What? revenge? Era, you can't even eat three meals! Is Kwak Cheol-yong your father? Fucking revenge? We shouldn't approach it with pure human emotions like revenge. Whether you pick a badge with a knife or get an ax, you earn money for it. Seeing that you called me, ask me to cut one of your hand hairs.
Please cut both.
How can I go to the bathroom alone if I cut both? The shit should be cheap and live, no matter how ugly. What kind of guy?
You don't know that it's Connie. The glassesman and the two go together, but now I don't know where they are.
How do you find it without glasses? The third person of the Joseon Dynasty is wearing glasses. How do you turn it when you turn it? Snap? Big move?
It's hard to get around.
Huh. How do you look at other people's hands?
I do not know.
Are you wearing a ring?
Uh... Yes.
Noisy when you earn money?
Yes.
That's the Shiver. High Gwangyeol. Try it. We're all wanted nationwide with ten calls. Keep two rooms in the hotel. Put some thorns.
Things underneath Jung Madam. Prepare your tea. Do you meet that bitch like this...
Hello.
Have you run out of beer?
Yes?
It's me. swan. Ask Hwaran if he needs beer.
Are you running out of beer?
do not know. many.
I asked if I ran out of beer.
Hello, hello. There are a lot of beer.
It's me, Connie.
Uh... then two boxes of height.
I'm curious, are you okay? Business?
Huh. Mr. Hwaran? Was it difficult?
Just... when will you send Hite?
Five o'clock tomorrow. It's pretty because you loose your hair.
I'm going to 100 million.
400 million. I die or die.
Will you die if you die? ... I get 400 million.
Is everyone dead?
Should I get this or not? Huhhoo~ 400 million to 400 million more. What will you do?
My breath is suddenly choking. Okay, let's see how big it is. take it. do not know! I do not know! If you don't eat this time, you're really going to die.
The boss.
............... ......... I got it. 8 ding.
What do I do with egg money... What do I do?
What should I do? It's all luck.
Wait a minute... 9 ding.
angler fish?
Simple tongue. Please introduce me to Hogu Hunte. I'm going to hit you in the hukou. You can just call Jung Ma-dam in front of me.
Hate!
I hate to do it.
I hate it. There is no evidence that Connie killed Kwak Cheol-yong.
Why is this! He said that the big hit now is Noguji. If I give it strength, it will make you diarrhea.
Are you threatening me now? I'm Jeong Madame.
I know. Jung Madam! Want to die poor? Would you like to see your name in the newspaper tomorrow?
... Are you going to kill Connie?
Look. You said I like it. Draw, even though the world is fucked, love is forever. Is this it? Don't worry. I'll see the blood.
There is no luck in this. I'll think about it.
Ehe~ If you have a lot of imagination, life will be difficult.
You're going to meet anyway.
Good. Because it's a business, I hit it, I own it.
What business is it? Can he know?
Am I doing this?
no. On the train that day.
What train?
You know the train. Flat-range train.
I do not know.
I was on the flat-panel train back then. The face is tired, too, in a different cell.
I sleep a long time and the train suddenly stops. For some reason, I was looking out of the air and the scene was flat. At that time, some guy got off the train and ran away, but he just turned around.
So I'm seven and you're three.
Hands off.
Why is that? Pretty Jung Ma-dam.
Oh Dae-oh. If you don't like it, do it.
method? Believe in such a warm feeling. Then shall we start? Introduce me to Hogu as a technician, and call him from him.
A man who said he looked like a moist flower to me... I should kill a man who learned a woman in my arms. Really... I was hoping this would not happen in my life. Really desperate... But why does the world repeat over and over again?
Mr. Kwang-Ryeol? I'm Jeong Madame. There is another plate tonight.
Welcome. Here are our nephews, but since I'm robbed, I'm here to help. Can I play together?
of course. Money matters, people matter.
Since there are too many caches, it's all a check from now on. Let's keep it here and chip it.
I have to sit down. Let's play clean and hot today.
Let's clean it up. If you have a person who is writing while writing Demai, use your hammer to smash your finger.
Let's do it.
Gambling, they're also giving their lives. Do you think I've been through the prenatal battle?
No one hits his fists and hits the battlefield. Create a horror atmosphere, and idiots. Let's not stop Gwangyeol. I'm the only hitter here right now.
Stop working! Are you kidding from the first edition? I'll put all my money and one hand on me that there's a piece of paper on your palm. What would you bet?
Why is this?
uncle! That's why you forgot your money. It took a while. Bring the hammer. If you have a close hand, take something else. Gyeongsang-do's unreceived ear was earmarked.
Then you? .. what?
Hehehe...
It's your turn.
There will be a taxi when you come out the back door of the kitchen. Ride it...
Connie! Gwang-ryul... What should I do...
Why is Gwang-ryul your brother?
Gwang-ryul said he was hurt.
Who is it?
Misters here.
... Change the guys next to you.
It's been a long time.
What happened to Kwang-ryul's older brother?
I was washed while fighting with Aguirre. I can't even make a phone call. swan
A woman named Jeong Madame knows. how? Change your lover?
done. That girl is not my lover.
Really? It goes well.
I'm stupid
Technicians are going out of skill, like samurai going to fight. If you are discovered while using the technique, you may have a knuckle or a wrist may be cut.
Can you die?
It's not me. because? I'm not sure about the game. Don't you believe?
Let's bet once? I'll put an odd number of 100,000 won. Would you bet on an even number?
Let's walk.
9? How did you know it was odd?
I left it here.
There is nothing to be afraid of or unfair to. Everyone I know is dead or injured. Pyeongjangjang. Park Moo-Seok. Kwak Chul Yong. High glow.
Today Connie dies in my hand. The problem is money, but be careful, that bitch is pretty.
We always get money. You care only about it.
About Connie?
What is it?
I'm waiting for you.
Why did Kwang-ryul attach his brother to you?
Well... I couldn't help it. Hogu asked about Tajja, but an angler came.
Didn't you know?
Don't keep doing it to me. I'm only worried about myself. Now I.
This woman... doesn't make eye contact with me.
Ah~ You have to do really well tonight. I got my entire property. How are you going to hit it Operation?
no. I'm just going to use natural bread.
Natural bread?
Did you eat dinner? I don't know when to eat again.
Why is this like this? Don't be speechless. Anyway, I go out blatantly and have eaten all the sweet and salty shit of the world.
He's got it. Let's do this. Let's cut one arm when we're all out of money. Sounds fun, doesn't it?
It's fun.
Heo Heo Hey, boot up on Captain's ship.
Yelim! You don't know how scary these guys are, but even get off the boat now. I'll take you out of here.
Are you pretending to be good in this yard right now? It's hell here. They live on their own.
Will you just die all night?
Naive or not! When did you pay for the death?
Very~ I'm worried. I'm afraid my arm will be cut Stop uncle.
Should I trust only my nephew... Captain! Do you know how to go?
It is fifteenth grade.
Stay with me.
Look at it slowly. To die or not.
That's weird. Only dogs come in. die.
You're welcome.
Good. 9 ding. I noticed it quickly.
A lot of money has been reduced.
There are still many. Icheon.
Five thousand.
100 million.
100 million?
You can die. Dying so well.
Take 100 million.
It was good. What is it?
Clean.
Five. haha
I must change my ax.
This bastard.
Now, you have to use technology. It's cool A dagger flies into the chest and sticks. But don't worry. Hands are faster than eyes. One piece for the Gundal. One piece from the bottom. One piece from under Jeong Madam. A piece of me. One piece for the Gundal. Anyway, sound is no evidence. It is a piece from the bottom again. Now the last piece to Jung Ma-dam.
Stop working! Is it a subtract?
Why are you doing that? Let go of this hand.
Do I look asshole? My hand and Jung Ma-dam's hand went from the bottom, right?
Could it be...? Do you have any evidence?
evidence? Yes! Isn't this the one you want to give to Jeong Ma-dam? Take a good look.
You would have given me 9 dots.
And I'm going to give Jung Ma-dam a long shot, so I'm going to end the game.
It's getting ridiculous. I do not know.
There is evidence.
Yelim! Did you see the hand you received first?
no.
Look at that. Is it Zhang?
Don't touch that hand. As soon as you touch it, blow it away. That's the autumn leaves, but I bet my money and everything. What do you want?
Why do I bet?
Bring the hammer.
Wait a minute. Do you want to see blood like that?
You don't know how to bleed if you get caught?
Good. Then let's grow more plates. The boss, please get a cup there.
I will hang my neck with all my money that this plaque is not a foliage. If you are not confident, give up.
Where does the fuckin sell medicine?
Why is the tongue so long? Does the devil of the world suffer too?
OK! My family is full of money and I hang my wrists.
No. I have to hang my neck.
My hand.
Wait a minute. It's my fault. Let's do what wasn't there.
Should I do this?
Do not dry. This is a fair game. When this kind of person is removed from Korea, inter-Korean reunification is faster, and it is also helpful for national unity.
Let's check it out.
Sakura!
Cherry Blossom? I can't... I can't. I saw it. I watched this bitch take off the bottom.
Do you do that crazy thing to make it clean? You're right. You're asshole. Are you a hitter with a 1/17 odds?
What are you doing? Take this guy's hand.
Hey Captain! Turn your stomach.
What are you doing? Hit it down!
Please save me. You weren't supposed to do this.
What are you doing?
awhile. In the next room, Kwang-ryul takes out his brother.
Why did you kill Pyeongjangjang?
No no no
I'm going down! Hit it down!
Jung Madame killed it!!
Shut up!
Why did you kill?
I don't know. We've been good together. Solve it nicely. good.
good?
... Don't look at me like that. It was like you. I want to have you. You can come to me without a flatfield.
Is that so? Is that why?
When did Connie start doing this? Huh? Is it Park Moo-suk? I started when I was in the Pyeongjangjang. That I was the Pyeongjangjang's protector. But he left me and ignored me... he ignored my money. My money. You saw Connie. You threw money at me... You saw. Do you understand me? So let's talk after taking the money.
Now we don't know.
Are you okay?
... Did you win?
Smashed it.
Well done.
Don't keep saying. Asshole.
What are you doing. Release it from this.
... dip.
Sorry brother!
swan! Are you going to that bitch? Huh? do not go. I can shoot. I can shoot...
Maw, asshole.
Should we go in?
wait.
So we... are you... rich?
then.
Seran... I would like it.. Was it really good with you and me? Just eat it...
Small business walking around.
You too... go.. to Hwaran.
Should I stop now?
When you enter the terminal.
I'm sorry, brother.
Jeong Madame?
I killed Pyeongjangjang to have Goni, but now I had to kill Goni. What are you doing with this? Ironic?
Your child... your mother is in the next room. Visiting time 5 minutes!
That's Okay. End it quickly.
I fell off the train.
Hey~ Can I cover you inje? Anything to say?
do not have.
Where did Connie go? Did you return to your hometown? Or where is a nice restaurant in a nice place? About a year later, I heard from someone. Go Kwang-ryul and Seran got married and set up a small beauty salon, and one day the parcel was delivered. In that small, heavy box, surprising news was waiting. Where did Connie go? I don't know.
