Wait a minute......
Last thing I want to ask. What is your name? What is your name~!!
Act 1 is the appearance of an elevator, so please stand in the correct position.
Who is she? Are you saying you have a missing child?
Child, why are you doing this again?
Do you believe that? Little kid, are you the stage director right?
What is a kid?
You don't need to know, child! Why?
Charry has arrived. I only change clothes in the car.
character. character. It starts 4 weeks ago.
Take a break. Starting like you've been waiting, isn't it?
Break 10 minutes.
Oh, no kid, director. I'm getting latte...
of course.
Open hot latte.
The work clothes look good too.
Yeah? !
What are you doing here? We promised... did you?
Yes. no. Not today.
Because it is. I thought it was a flight today...
I'm busy, am I?
I have 5 minutes.
I only have 10 minutes.
Yes, Woohyun... Yes, I'll go...
I came because I wanted to give it before I left. You said you liked the movie ¡®Morning at Tiffany¡¯?
Tiffany... Audrey Hepburn... It doesn't suit me.
Cuddle, you'll know.
I said it before, but I still...
It goes very quickly in 5 minutes.
Ah-!
Jiwoo! this......
Ah, customer~ It's been a while since the arrival of a visa-free entry
Missing, kidnapping, violence, robbery, drugs...
Nowadays, even bombings occur. Plus to Buenos Aires
What Interpol are you? Why collect this?!
I just want to give you minimal information on local safety...
So why are you worried! The security there is the market there, and you, the sensual tango,
I still need to know...
You know you've been struggling with the company cut these days? Go.
French what?
Yes? Eh... Eiffel Tower
Brazil what?
Samba!
Indonesia.
. Tsunami?
!! Bali! Bali!! Honey's Heaven, Bali!!
Get out now-!!
Onegashimatsu~~
Are you from headquarters? Good job.
Hi-cheese-
What are you doing now? I'm going to report it as sexual harassment!
Oba-san's Nike-desu, Honto-nike-desu!!
Where is Han Ki-jun? Just one step. You are really fired!
... 
Move more systematically and strategically!
Where? This night.
Our doctor Jung is coming out, this night.
Uh... don't cross the line yet. I have a sister too...
What am i?
Isn¡¯t it?
too big. Take out the mulberry.
Snow. Is it too big?
Big. Big.
who? Ah... he's busy. I went to New York today.
Wow~ Are you already on the schedule? Hey. That's great.
Yes, pushing and pulling is also done by kids, and at that age, if you pull it properly, it's over. Maybe it's the last man in his sister's life.
Last?
okay. First and last destiny. Yumma. It's a perfect match.
How long have you met...
After a month's presentation, a quote will come out. I thought one of his friends' driving forces was certain...
Didn't you go over there?
Are you caught? Did you? I absolutely have to wear wisdom. I...
A day or two. I think I'll vomit just by looking at the pink color.
But this...
Dad, you know...
It's a good day to love, isn't it?
Well, nothing else, ballet tuition.
... Where are you going?
Yes, Dobongsan. The background of this work is Annapurna.
Are you getting a book this time?
It will come out. soon.
... you will.
Princess, Dad, I'm going~
Isn't that a cartoon over 10 years old?
Did you eat breakfast?
Give me a glass of milk.
Aren't you going to work today?
Say it, sister. In words.
In words?! I'm glad he didn't send a goal after 30 years!
I can't help it being my brother-in-law. I was fired without a head around...
Do you call it comfort? When it is hard to get a job together these days.
... business.
What?
I'm going to do business!!
Take public service ads!! What's this business that can't even sell.
Anyway, I'm a woman with action.
Aren't you coming out soon?!
Move it.
Little kid, are you in the amusement park?
Don't go down the stage.
Don't get off, you bastard.
I didn't have my own room.
Well... there's only one personal dressing room. There are a lot of steps that Chai brings. Sorry...
The radio battery has run out, so I was wrong.
Change it now!
It's thrilling. But please be sure when I ride.
Did you tell the installation team to check the elevation?
What did you say? Stage director?
If you increase the amount of rice, it will be installed as a director...
Check the lighting team effect memory.
Stage dark battle. Look out. Dark Battle GO! Effect GO!
I'm meeting now. Yes Yes. I'll call you soon.
You're starting with the basic skills.
... I?
Innocent, still...
Know. Who does it look like?
Huh? Yeah, trustworthy... Anyway, it's a good face to do business with.
okay?
Did you get my business card? There are many spearmen, but it's not as sure as us
Really? Then, can I take a picture?
It's still meticulous. Yes, take it.
What's the relationship with Ahn Hyo-jung...
Perfect face,
I know, I...
It looks good to be scammed. Come out of a good school like this,
Misters, stay still! I'm proud to have come here without forgetting the old woman.
Old woman! First love, first love!
This is an alumni association.
Nevertheless, you guys need to know. Anyway, Hyojeong's first love was me.
What is so important?
Why doesn't that matter?
No, this is the first love in the world...
There are a lot of people coming to the police station for their first love. Drinking, fighting for the first love,
right! That's what I said.
When I meet my first love again, I live again.
Even if you give me billions of dollars, just find it...
going now. Yes. Yes.
That man, it could be the end of your sister's life.
okay. First and last destiny.
Cuddle, you'll know.
Mister!!
Mister! Please take this out!!
Ricksha's door is Tak-!)
Man's hand covering her eyes in the sand breeze)
!!
... How have you been?
Jongwook...
Phew...
You, Jong Wook Kim, you bitch!
Ow- Why are you fucking, really-
Why is your face like that? Dad, did you make a living room today?
Jiwoo, you... broke up with Choi Gi-jang!
Dad that... so that's...
If three people succeed, I will be independent.
...... two people...
here...
Welcome, sir. Finding the first love to find the first love.
So you're looking for... to do it? First love?
Yes?
What do you do after finding your first love, huh? You kid, I know I won't let you go if I find it!
I'm sorry. Finding your husband's first love.
I talked about her sometimes...
That's how you share your memories. Did you mention your name?
Name... Yes, that bitch... No, that girl's name...
If you find it, who will you contact?
Just kill him on the spot. Just think of the two guys who ran away...
Come in, dude!!
Are you here? Okay? Now just enter the venue. I'm embarrassed.
You dude, I have nothing to say about three thousand mouths.
So is this where you brought it? Still, at the level of his father, the retired National Intelligence Service
It's not an excitement.
Strictly registered as a business entity in corporate reporting,
Well, that's what it says... so are you looking for it?
It's a hundred pro.
No, to the back pro... it's close.
Accurate... if there are many... you can find it?
of course.
Good for you. When are you coming? I'm a bit busy.
Oh, there is... not every single day,
When the hell is coming, Chief Park...
Who are you looking for?
I do not know.
The Age?
I do not know.
What is your school of origin?
I don't know.
Are you kidding me?
Oh, I really don't know.
Your name?
Colonel Seo Han-soo.
This is a sergeant based on the reserve.
Want to see? Until it? Once in the 12 divisions of our unit...
Kim! ...
Kim. Bell. Wook.
Thank you...
Lonely angle of the jaw line. The sharp intelligence of the nose.
That's it. Huh~
Some shells. So?
So... I'm going to the desert.
Woman alone in the desert?
It's great. What are you going to do?
That's it, don't laugh. Uh... I can't laugh...
camel. That's a lot of motion sickness than I thought. Please wear Kimite.
Kimite. Ah... Kimite. Thank you.
So, are you going to Jaisalmer?
Wow~ How do you memorize it all?
You only need to read the guidebook once. It's a desert...
We are in India right now.
Just say it's all over, what...
So, have you been together since then?
...... no.
If there is a relationship, we will meet again.
Yes, if there is a relationship...
Excuse me, my name is...
Why did you do that?
I just don't think it should be that easy...
Okay die? Then he dies!
How long should I be listening to that?
When I call my little boy, I want to be better than that.
Yeah? When did you tell the enemy...
Why- It's definitely a debut song. Is that the end of the first album?
Act 1 chorus is going!!
Director. What is a kid?
Noisy, dude.
By plane to Delhi... Total flight time: seven and a half hours...
Direct flights from Osaka...
after-
Jjapsalmengyu?
Yes? Jaisalmer, Jaisalmer.
This is a must for Indian travelers. Tar desert, camel tracking...
Dad!
It is not uncommon to find a dad when you are in a hurry. How are you?
I... Excuse me. I can't. Ouch-!!
It would be unreasonable to ride a camel. A day or two would be very uncomfortable...
no. We will meet again like this. We really...
If there is a relationship?
Could you tell me... when he comes back? Really? he already checked out this morning? 
I'm crazy. I'm crazy.
You know this man? I have never seen anyone before who got travel sick on the camel. 
Hold on like this...
Ah black
Do you still have it? You have to hold on to it for a hundred days, so what do you do?
I buy it in strict blackmail.
He is a former employee. Do you know? I'm not fired, even the manager?
You know. I can't lie.
Boldly! Go around!
I really can't.
I'm the manager of Silk Road!!
In the meantime, how long has Silk Road been doing business with here?
The country you are looking for...
1999. India.
Goodbye, manager.
Jongwook Kim... Jongwook Kim...
Team leader, team leader!
I'll ask. Please replace the elevation. It's dangerous for me.
Director Seo, what makes you really weird? If anyone hears, I think it's our responsibility.
I mean... you know. I have to hold on for more than two months, but it's too old.
So, don't do this to me, tell the company directly.
Fuck, real!!
??
The cell phone was off.
But if you come here...
Did you go to your home?
no! Not that...
I'm sorry, today I just- I can't, I'm sorry.
Yes? Why all of a sudden...
As you know, I couldn't do it because of my dad, but I wasn't very good from the beginning.
Who is this for money?
It started with one name. I haven't found it yet, but it's still a lot.
I see. Okay, later on the phone...
You don't answer the phone! Me, I can't give up like this!
Hey! This is my workplace.
I understand it's scary, but I have to go from the beginning to the end.
I'm really... outrageous... well...
Since then, I have a wide range of connections and... I'm fine. Jiwoo, I'm confident you won't be disappointed. I'll wait. Please contact.
Yes, haha- It's been a long time.
I was so glad to see you at the police station. But, Jae-ha, you're going to NIS then...
I'm sorry, Jaeha. The KFDA is also good. But who knows at the National Intelligence Service... Hello?
Lift.
Yeah? Yeah...
I'm begging you. You may know if you have a daughter in the future,
Ah I...
Why not drink?
No, rather than that... Because there's not much to do with health...
Yes, if you think about your health, you shouldn't drink it.
I don't like... I don't like sweating.
So what do you take care of?
Mainly eat vitamins.
Heoheom. Are you tired? I haven't had much time left.
Yeah? Yes. It's kind of open.
Growing up without a mother, however, there is something timid since childhood.
Yes. It's really...Sim... not.
That's why. Get this.
What is this?
Wisdom finds it, but I guess what I wrote when I was in India. It's not a diary, it's a diary.
Thank you. father. No Colonel. Thank you.
So if Jiwoo wants to give up, don't get tired and keep going to the theater.
Yeah! Okay!
But you have a new year...
Yeah?
Nope. Eat some rice.
00 Arrival in Delhi, India
Are there any habits that others do not know? I have a habit of turning on music when I sleep.
Um... I sleep when I turn off the stand. And when I fall asleep, I don't know who goes by.
How am I.
Write-!
It's desert, so beer here, how hard. It's Shandy.
so sweet...
I'll sleep on the sofa.
Doesn't your leg hurt in the morning when you sit and sleep?
It's okay.
excuse me. When are you going back to Korea?
More.
Then I have to go to Delhi tomorrow.
right.
Oh, I see.
Isn't there a flight to Korea right here?
right. There is no airport.
Oh, I see.
No!!
what is this...
I'll turn, really... assistant director! Why what...
What's going on, why don't you jump out now?
Your boyfriend is here.
Why again?
You were embarrassed last time, right?
Yeah?
I can't think of Jiwoo's position, and I'm so in a hurry... I'll be careful from now on.
Well... it would be nice if you could...
Director Niim~ The place of the press conference has changed due to Chae Lee. Come to the suite practice room.
Hey!! driving me crazy...
Then... I will contact you as soon as I find it.
excuse me...
?
Are you going to the office? Yaksu-dong.
Yes, by the way?
What should I do in writing, I have to step on it!
That's the signal.
So you should have stepped on it!
Where does the delivery go? It's really... How did this person think about going to India?
Yeah?
That's right. Well, peace of mind, isn't that where people looking for it go.
I saw a picture.
I'm not going?
Our sweet members are so envious of me doing musicals.
Even if you say this, you're a friend with a sense. Lots of stage experience...
Why are you here?
What did those people come to see me?
Would you like some coffee?
I'm sorry. It's not latte.
done. Throw it away, well. Honey, you got a lover?
Yeah?! Who is it? Director is like that? Lighting director? Set team... Woohyung, this bitch!!
All-
I'm not a lover. It's just someone I met for work.
Then you go out and do it. What, is there anything between men and women?
No! Never with that person! never! no.
......!
I thought you left it...
excuse me!
Good drink. But it's not good.
Mr. Han Joon~ Mr. Han Joon~
Hey- Han Critic!!
!! 
yet?
...... 
The woman... how are you? I'm curious... to be honest,
Puck.
Kiya- I think it's a woman like India.
Who is that man?
I thought I wasn't coming...
I've been a senior for a long time, but if I get a pod, I keep making fun...
With that said, I understand from now on that I will actively cooperate.
All these people? Hey... if you take a picture...
No. In 10 years, the impression will change completely.
Does that mean I'm following each one? What do you do?
Because it went up to the show, it's a break on Monday.
You've been here, though. Isn't the start half?
Chief Park... Hey- Chief Park!
I?
No So, you mean cooperating or not?
Do it, do it! year!
What if he doesn't recognize me?
The person can find out first.
... Perhaps?
?? 
God... how much I am...
Who? Why is this like this?
Brother~!!
You may be disappointed to see me now.
More breasts... should I grow?
Or what if I'm disappointed with him.
Jongwook is here?
Are you new?
Why are you so late? If you do something wrong, you will miss the boat.
You know? After the show started, I couldn't take a day off.
No, where do you go to see the flowers now? A- yeah, I'll spill.
I can¡¯t even eat rice while waiting...
I don't eat walnut sweets.
A- thing. It's kind of like eating alone.
Then you don't have to.
Oh, yeah! Don't spill it!
Did you leave the last boat? what can I do...
Yeah?
I did it on purpose. On purpose... all the men are the same...
Lady~ Take the ticket.
Yeah? Yeah...
Originally, the main character is late.
What if it doesn't last?
What do you think about Jiwoosi? What if the main character doesn't appear in Jiwoo's performance?
It never happens!
I know well.
why?
Will I go? No, we just go.
It's okay. You didn't necessarily say happy ending.
Phew...
Take it quickly. Let's go one more place and finish.
I'm going to do it today.
It's near...
...Go. I'll take you.
Let's go first.
What is Jiwoo?
I just want to go somewhere.
where? bar? I really hate drinking. I'm not going together!
I want to be alone today.
Ah-really!!
I have to dribble. Ah- do it, do it, do it-
Jiwoo... please go...
Where are you going? The game is not over!!
It's not over-! It's the 2002 World Cup! Yes, Ahn Jung-hwan scores a goal!
goal! goal!! What a hell-!! saw? saw? Ahn Jung-hwan, Dunk Shot!
That's basketball!
I'm crying. So good So good!!
Crazy bitch, really...
What are you doing? He doesn't drink and he always does things like this?
That's not... I mean... what is your daughter's personality...
Is this person Jongwook Kim?
Yeah? No, I...
Who are you looking at? Hey, Seo Ji-hye, are you crazy?
Hey, hey! Sister, yum!
Jongwook, it's not him! Not that person! Don't mess it up!
!! 
after...
Really good.
Dad.....
After thirty, I was late looking for my first love,
What are you talking about? Who is with him?
I wasn't bad.
What, dude?! Where? It's a completely different version from Dad. The man must be man.
If you see your sister come up, you have a responsibility.
Excitement. I dragged it. I wiped out alleys in the neighborhood with my daughter.
It's cute. That's okay for my sister. I want more.
Hey. I have life too.
My sister doesn't deserve to say that. That man, you must have been hurt yesterday.
What am i doing?
I really don't know? When will you wake up? Will you prepare for Chuseok next year?
Oh, what did I do?
Oh go and ask yourself.
Why are you doing this? from morning.
Was it a standard?
Yumma. You still have time to go to work.
I'm going to stop by somewhere.
But delete it. Wait a minute. The friend, what's the year of birth?
Dad!!
Those who seek love, look into the abyss.
... Who said that?
Huh? I.
No... I think I saw it...
What sound. I wrote it in 1998 as a virgin...
You don't know love yet?
!!... I know?
Yes, at that time, I played with my friends at school. Oh my gosh...
Huh? Ah... well... sooner or later... that's it,
What are you doing? So voluntarily...
Yesterday, they said they would be grateful... I don't remember, so...
I can't remember well. Just wake up in the morning, my God...
Huh? Did you buy your sister to join your brother-in-law?
... brother-in-law?
The smell of the domestic water industry was... well, how about it?
For some reason, you are coming out generously. Like many people who did something wrong.
Yes. sorry. I'm here to say sorry. But it was not very good.
People, look at what I'm making fun of. I'm sorry.
She's a woman who likes it.
I'll postpone the house opening 15 minutes before the performance. Has the van arrived?
came!!
Beginning with the first act, there is 12 minutes to reach Charley.
Did you worry a lot?
Are you already here?
Sensei, if Chary's breathing becomes shorter, please support him.
When did you not?
Five minutes before the show.
Jiwoo. Are you still performing?
I made a mistake earlier.
The message was canceled.
What's wrong? Going well... Aye, again...
Jiwoo? I'm sorry, I'm so mouth-watering... Mae-hyun...?
It's called Wolchulsan Kim Satgat, and it's a mountain hut, but it's quite famous among climbers.
A little feeling, doesn't it come?
What?
I'm coming... read a little more.
Wow, this is... at least two days and one night.
If you leave early Monday morning, you will arrive on Tuesday morning. It's exactly 2 days without sleep.
Kim Jong-wook is really tired of people.
uh? Now, I swear Kim Jong-wook, right? I was just annoyed that I was tired, to that person?
Wait, aunt, here's an empty bowl...
Are you going to the Himalayas?
Where are you going to the local water spring?
No, I'm putting that on how long.
I can't drive long. My body is sensitive. I can't sleep well even if I change my sleep...
You were a travel agent?
Do you go to travel agencies? Nonetheless, one of those information sources was clear.
Airline reservations, accommodation, exchange rates...
Again, again... that expression comes out.
Huh?
When I talk about India, when I talk about Jongwook Kim, my eyes are narrowed like this...
I think it's a wonderful memory, so it's dazzling...
That's great. If it's so good, why didn't you meet again?
On the day I decided to meet, I missed the transfer flight from Osaka to Korea.
At that time, Osaka didn't rain like that...
Again, I haven't been there, I just look at the Internet...
Why is this like this? When I lived as an exchange student, I made all the local confectionery.
Walnut sweets?
Wow, Wow, Wow, Yo!!
Or why not be angry? I've also had Japanese sweets. Also in Japan.
Are you hungry? Wait- instead I...
I've got some food to eat... This is... Why...
Oh, that's it! Just sit, I'm not hungry.
Wait a minute... this is...
Well, I... help me...
...
Jiwoo... Jiwoo...
What do you do when you sleep? Or I should have awakened the country.
I was tired of picking up rice! Please help me like that...
Didn't you bring a stick?
Yes? what?
Stick, stick!
Oh, stick... I just left it. Too long...
Hold it.
No. Jiwoo is also difficult... Thank you.
How far is it to the hut? I think it will get dark soon.
It's my first time, too... shall I call you out? Jong-wook Kim?
Explain here.
here...
Jiwoo... Let's go.
Jiwoo, are you okay? Jiwoo... Can you see me?
Surprise-! Surprise...
I think I'm lost...
No... Hello! Nobody!! Save people!!
Jongwook Kim- Hey, Jongwook Kim... It's going to be cold, but bad guy...
Please sing a song.
I'm not in the mood to sing now
The best way not to get lost in the mountains is to get rid of fear.
I... sing everywhere and I'm not that kind of person.
Why is that song?!
Why... I loved it when I was young
lie! You know? Did you know? Since when?
You know, then! I was invited to the university freshman welcome meeting... but quietly went to the army...
Jongwook Kim... I won't let you go...
there...
Jiwoo, we are all here. Just bear a little...
This is Kim Jong Mook. My name is. Sorry for the disappointment.
No. Someone has been riding the mountain for a long time...
It's great though. It is not easy for beginners to ride, but it is carried by a woman.
How hard was it,
I was crying.
After all, it's not.
Jongwook Kim, it's not that easy.
You must be foolish. I envy you, the person named Jongwook Kim.
Why are you doing this?
A-Cham- It's because it's snowing...
I'm curious, your first love.
It's just a normal lady, well. The last thing I saw was wearing a wedding dress.
Can't you confess once or twice?
I only regretted it. If I met a little earlier, if I had a little more courage...
It's okay. It's not because of ties.
no. I guess it was because I wasn't so desperate.
Last night... anything...
no!!
You can't miss it.
It's okay?
Sometimes like this. Don't mind
That's Okay!
Stay still. If Jiwi is sick, I'm more uncomfortable.
! 
Good job!
I see! Where are you coming?
Yeah? Well... you have to repeat it!
Do you know what we went to empty?!
I'm sorry, seat here...
Should I drink?
It was just like this. I used to work part time in Japan...
Do you hate even walnut sweets?
I don't like everything that looks sullen.
It's pretty, but it doesn't have any medicine if you pretend to eat sweets.
Uh, you know that?
I know a little.
uh! I like this music...
Say you're out of school, don't you sing anymore?
Dreams are just, dreams, well.
It's weird because Jiwoo says that. Someone who seems to fly away soon.
Me? An angel with wings... What, is that it?
It's a little less realistic.
What is it?!
But it's good as it is now.
Mr. Kijun, I think he is a good person
!!
An angel with wings?
We broke up.
What?
see? People who have a hard time dating because of the hospital,
Wisdom...
Aw- I'm embarrassed, really... I think I'm proposing...
Surprise... Let's do the song right, shh.
uh? came? What happen?
Are you here to convey this? Anyway, Criteria...
I don't think I will see you next time.
Yeah?
I found it. Jongwook Kim.
How funny it would have been to see me.
... Sorry.
I knew it from the beginning.
At first... I didn't say it because I didn't want to find it.
Have you ever wanted to find it from the beginning? Tell me.
... You said, I couldn't get on a transfer flight in Osaka because of the rain.
On that day, there was no rain at Osaka Airport.
What is there if you go all the way? There is nothing.
So!! You can start over.
Please wait.
White train smoke coming into the hook. Jiwoo's face revealed in the meantime,
music...
cue-
On the man's palm, '2000. 1. 20. pm 7
! 
Seniors- !!
Yes.
Hello? ... Want to find your first love?
You can't dirty the song.
uncle! Turn it! Turn!!
... Dad.
Why are you so good alone? It's hard for me to keep two girls without my mom.
It's an accident. It's not me, the stage is broken, why do you say my life is broken?
But why is there no one to listen to one side! Is that... Are you living well?
...
Ugh- this idiot!!
sister.
cheer up.
Strangely... not good.
welcome...
This is Park Sang-hoon's studio...
Good morning. Export judge planning team, Seo Sujin...
Please sit here. Come here... one head-
How do you feel about Jiwoo?
Do you like Japanese sweets?
Yes? of course! How pretty... it looks good, it's good to eat...
They say they eat wrong.
... Yeah?
Hello?
What are you looking at?
Why did you recommend me again?
So, how do you order that long coffee order?
But what is it?
Huh, I'm not- No, no matter how, how do you find someone who doesn't even know your name?
You are here. I don't even know his name anymore...
Yes, it is one standard for the first love office. Yes Yes...
Ah... Then you met him at the destination? Ten years ago, first on a plane...
Is there any name...
Standby actors...
Director, Charry...
Leave the emergency exit open, and carry the makeup tools to the car next time...
I can't seem to come.
!! 
I was stuck in the middle after going to a local performance, but I think I should cancel the performance...
Crazy!! Anyone can cancel the show at will!
You know. All-
Yeah?!!
Hey- torn-
Director! This is ridiculous-!!
Start of performance Standby...
cue-
What do you think? Isn't it different from what I was singing in the theme song?
Seniors. Today, thank you.
Today only? Always- thank you. Wouldn't you do it again?
A lover came outside.
Yeah?
Go.
Why is the face you met after a long time?
I missed you. No, I missed you.
Yeah?
... Jongwook Kim.
Eventually I found it. Congratulations.
It wasn't me, he found it. Or really...
Is there such a thing as relationship?
Without? Did I tell you anything? Another accident. Sorry.
Why did you just do what Kijun did...
Iknow, right. I just did what I had to do... I'm fine.
I have to go. Everyone is waiting. It's a five o'clock flight.
Criteria...
...	
... Thank you. All...
20¡±
Think until this day and come out to the airport. If I am the real fate.
Don't overdo it. I can get sick later.
I have a question to ask.
What's your name?
You?
Me? My name is¡¦ !!
Will you meet him?
I do not know. I'm not sure if it's really true.
You want to be connected or not.
That's fixed. Dad did. If you wait, everything will appear.
That's because it was perfect for you to see.
What- I was believing in secret...
Don't, so you're still far. If it's fate, I have to hold it.
I think wisdom came.
Damn. ?
Marriage was actually scary. Honestly, I was sorry that I only met you.
Ah, I'm over there... Wisdom, wait a minute...
Baby... pretty, really...
Dear Mrs. Lee, To the strict director Park...
Welcome... a proxy?
Indo... what do you want to visit here?
Sure, high customer. Isn't it a country of souls when guided?
The manager must go first.
Hahaha- That's... How do you... think about going to India...
I'm a little interested. Because of some woman.
Do you have a surrogate woman? Would you like to go... together?
no. The woman said she went. 10 years ago.
So, alone?
I was wondering what the hell I was like. What the hell is the air and how it smells...
One deputy... Are you okay?
What country, manager? What the heck, do you remember decades?
One deputy... why?
Jongwook Kim meets? Choose it.
It's my first love in 10 years, but no matter what, I have to see it properly.
... How are you?
What are you? It's been a while since I started working, this bitch is missing.
Ah-hhh-!!
Just let me live my own way! When you want to leave like others, leave,
...Basicist, you... why are you...
Ah- I don't know! Me too! I want to go Indiana!
Do it, do it! Do you take an ad?!
Don't wear clothes right now!!
Stage director...
Do you want to surprise someone in many ways?
Sorry for the last thing... Thank you.
This is the first thing you give. Autograph... Can I do it?
Yes, please do.
uh? Director, shoes...
Stage director?
Please sign it.
Yes, it is a standard to find your first love...
C'mon- How do you catch someone you hate?
Whatever it is, I want to see it once.
Yeah?
Jongwook... Wait...
Uh, it was sugary... I thought I wasn't gonna drink it...
Brother.
Where, do you have any leftover Kim Jong-wook?
First love Han Cri... If you like it, then,
Me, brother.
Jongwook!!
Uncle, shit...
Mister, step on it!
!! 
Seo Ji-woo!!!
Alright die, very...
My mother?
No, my sister's boyfriend.
Why does your aunt's boyfriend play with my mother?
I'm not an aunt! What can I do? It's my first love...
Mom!!
Don't tell me anything. I met by chance.
by chance? How scary is that, don't you know?
It's like someone who happens to meet and worry about 10 years,
10 minutes? The person waiting is like an hour, it seems like a day...
Is not it? Is not it? Do you understand now? Look, you have to take it anyway...
what is this? So you met on purpose? Pretend to be a coincidence...
Come on? Who left you first?
It's the first love that made me fly from Osaka to Korea. What did you say?
What did you say?
Again, again... I didn't say anything. You came out soon.
I didn't cry! I just thought he was following Kim... He's living well?
Why? Can you find me again?
Hey!!
But when did you come from Osaka to Korea?
Well? I think it was summer... August?
Must go to Korea, please... please...
Sorry. It is not something we can help.
Help. In Korea, a woman you like is getting married.
... Wait. Ah, there is a flight from India one minute later.
Ticket... Can I change it in 3 days?
It would be difficult.
Are you going to Seoul?
Yeah!
I'll buy it!
Would you?
It doesn't matter if it's a cargo compartment. It's my destiny.
I want to leave fate as fate.
Yeah?
Yes, there is.
thank you. Oh, this is... a confectionery.
Thank you.
Look out. There is no medicine to eat and pretend to be like this.
Customer~ Ticket here...
